(Thus, a student will complete graduation requirements in four years of full-time academic work in the September-through-May academic year.) A minimum of sixteen course units must be taken at Gettysburg College or in an approved College program. The last full year of academic work must be completed as a full-time student. Unless given approval, students may not complete requirements as part-time students during their last semester of residence.</p>\n<p>Students proposing to complete graduation requirements in less than four full years must have their programs approved by the Academic Standing Committee through the Office of the Registrar. Such approval should be sought at least a year before the proposed completion of requirements.</p>\n<p>A full-time student for academic purposes is one carrying a minimum of three courses during a semester. No student who is a candidate for a degree may take fewer courses than this without permission of the Academic Standing Committee.</p>\n<p>After the first semester, students may enroll in five courses in any two semesters without petitioning for the right to do so; after two such five course unit enrollments, students will have to petition to overload. For the purposes of determining a full load of four courses, summer internship credit recorded in a subsequent semester will not count. The four course load will apply to study abroad programs. In all cases, students will be allowed to pre-register for only four one-unit courses, and those eligible for an overload may add a fifth course unit during the start-of-term registration period.</p>\n<p>Majors and minors in music must take quarter courses, in addition to the normal course load. Other students may take quarter courses in applied music, with the approval of the music department at an additional charge.</p>\n<p>A student may audit informally any College course with the permission of the instructor. No charge will be made for such an audit and no record of auditing will appear on the student's transcript.</p>\n<p>The College offers a limited opportunity for students to register for and complete a course of study during the summer. Primarily these are off-campus individualized study or internship courses and are arranged through academic departments.</p></div> <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>", "Policy_ID": "00c372d4-8773-448d-8e94-671b48d0c340", "Policy_Type": "Academic"}, {"Title": "Center for Global Education", "Content": "<div class=\"gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right\">\n<div class=\"gb-c-longform\"><p>If you are thinking about making global study a part of your education, you will be joining over 350 of your peers who study globally each year (almost 60% of the class of 2019).

But, the College also offers students the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities because it believes that these activities can make important contributions to their education as whole persons. The following statement describes the appropriate relationship between academic and extracurricular activities.</p>\n<h2><strong>Gettysburg College\u2019s Policy on Class Attendance and Absence</strong></h2>\n<p>The College recognizes that regular attendance at all classes is an essential part of its academic purpose and clearly is the responsibility of the individual student. Each student is accountable for all work missed because of absences from class, and instructors are under no obligation to make special arrangements for students who are absent from classes. Instructors must explain their individual or departmental attendance policy during the first class meeting and/or in their course outlines.</p>\n<p>Class absences will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis by the instructor of the course. There is no such thing as an \u201cofficially excused\u201d absence from a class at Gettysburg College. If a student will miss class for any reason (for example, religious observances, college trips, family emergencies, or illness), students must discuss this absence with their instructor in advance whenever possible. The student will be ultimately responsible for making up any missed work; however, in some cases, it may not be possible to make up missed work. When students are seen in the Health Center, they are provided documentation of each appointment, and they can share this documentation with faculty if needed.</p>\n<p>If you must miss class, we encourage you to notify your professors as soon as possible with as much information as you can provide about the date of your anticipated absence, the reasons, and your plan for making up any missed work. Students should ask the professor to let them know if they have any questions about the absence or any instructions to give about making up the missed work. Students should include in any written or e-mail message their campus box number, telephone number, and e-mail address.</p>\n<p><strong>On occasion, even if absences are due to documented medical or emergency situations, students may miss so much class that they are not able to meet the goals of the course. In these cases, students may be advised to withdraw from the course.</strong></p>\n<p>A student who receives an Excessive Absence Warning through the online Progress/Midterm Deficiency Report system is being formally notified that an instructor has warned the student about excessive absence in the course and that\u00a0further absence may result in the student being required to withdraw from the course.</p>\n<p>Academic Advising may notify faculty of certain student absences, by request, if the student is unable to notify faculty directly. Health Services does not write notes for students but will contact Academic Advising about student visits or certain diagnoses at a student\u2019s request. These notifications are not to be construed as \u201cofficial excuses\u201d sanctioned by Academic Advising; individual faculty are far better suited to assess the legitimacy of students\u2019 explanations for absence than is the Academic Advising office. Academic Advising does not notify faculty of sports or college related absences.</p>\n<h2><strong>Practice and Activities Times</strong></h2>\n<p>The period from 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Monday through Friday has traditionally been set aside for athletic practices and other extra-curricular activities. It is intended that activities such as band, choir, theatre productions, community service activities, and athletic practices will ordinarily take place during this time without conflict with scheduled classes or with other academic obligations, including make-up tests.</p>\n<p>It is a violation of NCAA regulations for a coach to require an athlete to attend a practice that conflicts with a class. Therefore, no student will be expected to miss a class or leave class early in order to be at practice.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, especially early in the second semester, indoor athletic practices must be scheduled. Because the College lacks sufficient space for all teams to practice indoors between 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., practices will occasionally meet at other times. No practice scheduled at a time other than 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. can be made mandatory for athletes. If such a practice conflicts with an assigned academic activity, the academic activity must take precedence. Apart from the condition just specified, no formal or informal team practices, training sessions, etc. should be scheduled at times other than 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>It is especially important that faculty let students know if testing; review sessions, extra classes, etc. will be scheduled in the 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. period. Faculty members should make every effort to avoid the situation where the only opportunity for a student to make up a test or complete some other required activity occurs between 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>An administrator from the College Life Division shall act as a liaison between students, faculty, coaches, and advisors of extra-curricular organizations should complaints or misunderstandings arise concerning the implementation of this policy. It will be the responsibility of coaches and advisors of extra-curricular activities to be sure that all students involved in athletics and these activities are aware of this person and his or her function.</p>\n<h2><strong>Absences Due to Athletic Contests or Other Extracurricular Activities </strong></h2>\n<p>As noted in the College\u2019s Policy on Class Attendance, it is the student\u2019s responsibility to request permission from faculty members to miss class because of a scheduled event and to make arrangements with the faculty members to make up any work missed because of an athletic contest or other extracurricular activity. If the level of anticipated absences is so high that the student may have problems in reasonably meeting the requirements of the course for class attendance and other matters, the student has the responsibility of determining whether or not it is possible for him or her to continue to participate in that extracurricular activity. If it is not possible to continue to participate in the extracurricular activity and still meet the requirements of the class, the student must decide whether to withdraw from the activity or, in certain circumstances, to postpone the class to a later semester.</p>\n<p>If, for any reason, (including injury or disciplinary sanction by a coach), a student will not be playing in an away game and this is known before the team leaves for the game, a student should be so informed and not be required to travel with the team. Coaches will encourage students who will not be playing in a contest (where the trip to the contest requires them to miss a class) to attend class rather than miss the class.</p></div> <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>", "Policy_ID": "0792495f-605b-4d9f-8fe1-f0d356c29a19", "Policy_Type": "Academic"}, {"Title": "Grading System", "Content": "<div class=\"gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right\">\n<div class=\"gb-c-longform\"><p>Courses are normally graded A through F, with these grades having the following significance:<br/>A (excellent); B (good); C (fair); D (poor); and F (failing). Instructors may modify their letter grades with plus and minus signs.</p>\n<p>In successfully completing a course under this grading system, a student earns a number of quality points according to the following scale.</p>\n<div class=\"gb-c-table-responsive\">\n<div class=\"gb-c-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A+</td>\n<td>4.33</td>\n<td>B+</td>\n<td>3.33</td>\n<td>C+</td>\n<td>2.33</td>\n<td>D+</td>\n<td>1.33</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>B</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A-</td>\n<td>3.67</td>\n<td>B-</td>\n<td>2.67</td>\n<td>C-</td>\n<td>1.67</td>\n<td>D-</td>\n<td>0.67</td>\n<td>F</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A student's accumulative average is computed by summing his or her quality points and dividing by the number of course units taken. The average is rounded to the second decimal place.</p>\n<p>The College reserves the right to make changes and adjustments in the grading system even after a student enrolls.</p>\n<p>The College offers a satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading option. This option is intended to encourage students to be adventurous intellectually in courses with subject matter or approaches substantially different from their prior academic experience or attainment. An S signifies satisfactory work, and is given if a student performs at the C- level or higher; a U signifies unsatisfactory work, and is given for work below the C- level. Courses graded S/U do not affect\u00a0a student's quality point average, but a course completed with an S grade will count toward the total number of courses needed for graduation. A student may elect to take a total of six courses on an S/U basis during his or her four years at Gettysburg College; however, no more than\u00a0two S/U courses may be taken in any one year. This grading option may not be selected for requirements for graduation, or for courses taken in a student's major field. Exceptions may be made with regard to the major in cases where a department specifies that a particular course\u00a0is available under the S/U grading system only, and in cases where the student declares the major after taking the course. A student must choose the S/U grading option during the first ten class days of the semester.</p>\n<p>Students who enroll in Education 476: Student Teaching may take an additional course under the S/U option during the senior year, provided that their total number of S/U courses does not exceed six.</p>\n<p>When a student registers for and completes a course which he or she has already taken at Gettysburg College, both the credit and the grade previously earned are canceled, but they are not removed from the permanent record. The credit and grade earned in repeating the course are counted toward the student's requirements.</p>\n<p>A grade of Inc (Incomplete) is issued through the Office of Academic Advising when emergency situations, such as illness, prevent a student from completing the course requirements on time. The missing work must be completed by the end of the add/drop deadline of the semester following the one in which the incomplete was incurred.</p>\n<p>A student who withdraws officially from a course after the ten-day add/drop period, but within the first eleven weeks of the term, receives a W (withdrew) grade. If a student withdraws from a course during the last five weeks of the semester, he or she will receive an F (failure) in the course. A student who withdraws officially for medical reasons receives a W regardless of the time of withdrawal. The W grade is not used in computing averages.</p>\n<p>The symbol N/F is used in cases where a student registers for a course but does not attend or participate in the course and then fails to withdraw properly. It is assigned 0 quality points and is used in the GPA.</p></div> <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>", "Policy_ID": "1599ad24-c2f2-487a-a67b-83ecc1bdd5f9", "Policy_Type": "Academic"}, {"Title": "Suspension, Leaves of Absence, and Reinstatement", "Content": "<div class=\"gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right\">\n<div class=\"gb-c-longform\"><p>Students are expected to be enrolled continuously from their matriculation through graduation. Understanding that unexpected events may occur, however, the College allows for leaves of absence. If a student withdraws from a course during the last five weeks of the semester, the student will receive an F (failure) in the course unless granted a withdrawal for approved medical reasons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For enrollment accounting purposes, all students will be withdrawn after 180 days from the last day of class attendance. Students who have been suspended, placed on leave, or withdrawn do not have to reapply for admission to the College, but they may be required to submit information for review and approval before being reinstated. Any such requirements will be set forth when the suspension or leave is initiated. Students may also voluntarily, permanently withdraw from the College.</p>\n<p>Students who have been suspended, placed on leave, or withdrawn may not remain on campus, may not participate in College activities, and may not visit campus.</p>\n<p>Gettysburg College reserves the right to initiate or require a leave or suspension for academic, disciplinary, medical, or behavioral reasons and reserves the right to defer or refuse reinstatement or return.</p>\n<p>Suspensions <br/> A student may be suspended for academic or disciplinary reasons. Please refer to the College policy on Academic Standing for additional information on academic related suspensions or the Student Code of Conduct for additional information on disciplinary related suspensions. At the time of suspension, the student will be notified of the semester that the student may be eligible for readmission to the College. A student academically suspended for a second time is not eligible for readmission.</p>\n<h2>Leaves of Absence</h2>\n<p>The College has three types of leaves of absence: Personal, Medical, and Behavioral (College-Initiated). All leaves are administered through the Office of Academic Advising. To initiate a leave of absence, a student must submit a leave of absence request form to the Office of Academic Advising. A student who is on leave may petition the Academic Standing Committee to transfer credit for courses taken at another institution. Proposals for such study <strong>must</strong> be submitted in advance to the Registrar for review by the Academic Standing Committee. All leaves will be refunded in accordance with the College\u2019s refund schedule. For further details about regulations and policies, consult the Academic Advising website. For information about refunding of tuition and fees, please consult Student Accounts or the <a href=\"https://www.gettysburg.edu/academic-programs/curriculum/catalog/policies/policy-details?id=c3e7a2e9-dff2-4da0-b770-01574e81aa56\">Withdrawal and Leave of Absence Refund Policy.</a></p>\n<p>1) Personal Leave. A student may request a Personal Leave at any time. If the College has information to suggest that a Medical Leave is appropriate, however, the College may refer the request to Health and Counseling for review and recommendations. At its discretion, the College may transmute a Personal Leave into a Medical Leave.</p>\n<p>2) Medical Leave. Medical Leave requires the support and approval of Health or Counseling Services. All applications for medical leave are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Students who are hospitalized during the semester require approval from Health or Counseling before being allowed to return to campus. Students may be advised to take a health leave following hospitalization, pending review on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>Students who are granted a Medical Leave are expected to be on leave for any remainder of the current semester and for the subsequent semester. Students who are granted late course withdrawals from some but not all courses are generally expected to take a Medical Leave for the subsequent semester.</p>\n<p>3) Behavioral Leave (College Initiated). The College will apply the procedures outlined in this policy to determine, at its discretion, whether a Behavioral Leave is necessary. Behavioral Leave generally carries the expectation that: a) student is withdrawn for the remainder of the current semester and the subsequent semester; and, b) completes associated requirements before being allowed to return to campus. Students are normally encouraged to consider a voluntary leave before the College initiates a Behavioral Leave. The College may implement Interim Measures (see \u201cInterim Measures\u201d below) during this process. Alcohol and Other Drugs leaves are addressed separately in the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>The College may initiate a Behavioral Leave if, in the judgment of the Dean of Students\u2019 Office, the student meets one or more of the following standards:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The student\u2019s behavior compromises the health and safety of self or others. This may include behavior that necessitates unreasonable measures to ensure the student\u2019s and/or others\u2019 wellbeing.</li>\n<li>The student\u2019s behavior is disruptive to others. This includes behavior that causes emotional, psychological or physical distress substantially above that normally experienced in daily life or that disrupts College operations.</li>\n<li>The student fails to comply with an assessment, intervention or Medical Leave recommended by the College because of academic, medical, or behavioral concerns. Where the recommended assessment is impossible, as with the student\u2019s failure to comply, indirect behavioral observations will constitute the basis for judgment.</li>\n<li>The student requires specialized care or interventions to manage behavioral issues that the College cannot reasonably provide.</li>\n<li>The student is enrolled but has a pattern of class absences demonstrating failure to maintain their enrollment status (full- or part-time).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Procedures for a Behavioral Leave</h2>\n<p>Any individual who believes that a student meets one or more of the standards described above should contact the Dean of Students\u2019 Office, which will refer the matter to an administrator designated as the Coordinator of the student\u2019s case. The Coordinator will appoint other personnel to form a Review Committee, which the Coordinator heads.</p>\n<p>The Review Committee may require an assessment of the student by a medical/psychiatric provider on- or off-campus to determine if the student meets the standards above. An assessment is not required in determining whether the standards above have been met, however. The Review Committee will consider all medical, psychological, observational and academic reports submitted with regard to or on behalf of the student that are relevant to determining the appropriateness of a Behavioral Leave. Treatment and evaluation reports should include information pertaining to diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. With the information available, the Review Committee will also determine if a reasonable accommodation can be made to maintain the student\u2019s enrollment.</p>\n<p>If the Review Committee concludes that the student does not meet any of the standards for a Behavioral Leave, it will inform the student in writing and this process will terminate. Generally, a member of the Review Committee will meet with the student to consider appropriate alternatives, including a behavioral contract or disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>If the Review Committee concludes that the student does meet one or more of the standards for a Behavioral Leave, the Review Committee will notify the student of its decision in writing and will include reasons for its conclusion. The Review Committee\u2019s decision will become effective immediately.</p>\n<h2>Appeal Process for a Behavioral Leave</h2>\n<p>A decision reached by the Review Committee may be appealed by the student to the Dean of Students\u2019 Office within five (5) calendar days of the decision. Such appeals should be in writing and include specific points the student wishes the Dean of Students\u2019 Office to consider. The Dean of Students\u2019 Office has five (5) calendar days to review the information presented and inform the student of the decision in writing. The Dean of Students\u2019 Office may (1) uphold the decision of the Review Committee, (2) adjust the finding, (3) refer the matter back to the Review Committee for further proceedings, or (4) reverse the decision of the Review Committee and reinstate the student. The appeal decision is final.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Interim Measures</h2>\n<p>To ensure the safety of individual students and the community, the College may take interim measures while working through disciplinary and Behavioral Leave reviews. Interim measures include residential separation or relocation, class schedule changes, restrictions from College activities and/or facilities, work or job assignment changes, \u201cno contact\u201d directives, temporary separation from the College, a health evaluation (see \u201cHealth Evaluation\u201d below), or other measures to ensure the well-being of all students.</p>\n<h2>Health Evaluations</h2>\n<p>Health evaluations must address 1) attendance dates of the evaluation and any previous dates of contact; 2) a description of the evaluation procedures (tests, interviews, etc.); 3) specifics about recommended courses of treatment; 4) an opinion about the fitness of the student to return to residential living OR suggestions for alternative arrangements; 5) an opinion about whether and under what circumstances the student appears to represent a danger to self or others. Based on the information submitted, the Director of Health or Counseling may refer students for additional evaluation if it is determined by the Director that more information is needed to determine eligibility for reinstatement.</p>\n<p>Students undergoing health evaluations must sign releases of information that allow 1) their medical/psychiatric providers to communicate with Health and/or Counseling Services; and, 2) Health and/or Counseling Services to communicate information to College Life. Releases are available on the Counseling Services website at <a href=\"/offices/health-counseling-services/counseling-services/general-releases\">https://www.gettysburg.edu/offices/health-counseling-services/counseling-services/general-releases</a></p>\n<p>Note that securing a valid health evaluation can take weeks; thus when a health evaluation is required, the student may be advised/required to take a leave.</p>\n<h2>Process for Reinstatement after Suspension or Leave</h2>\n<p>Students must resolve all incomplete coursework before they will be permitted to return from leave.</p>\n<p>Students placed on Suspension or Leave must follow the requirements set forth in writing at the time they left. Failure to do so or to provide accurate and complete information is grounds for denying reinstatement. Return may include stipulations concerning class schedule, extracurricular activities, place of residence or other conditions as may be judged to be in the best interest of the student and the College community. While the College seriously considers the opinions of external individuals (medical providers, e.g.), the ultimate decision about reinstatement belongs to the College. Thus, a recommendation for return from a student\u2019s healthcare provider(s) is not in itself sufficient grounds for reinstatement.</p>\n<p>Students may participate in upcoming registration activities after being officially approved for reinstatement.</p>\n<p>All students wishing to return from suspension/leave must notify Academic Advising of their intent to return per the following dates:</p>\n<p>Notification to Academic Advising</p>\n<p>Suspension April 15 for fall return</p>\n<p>November 1 for spring return</p>\n<p>All other leaves May 1 for fall return</p>\n<p>November 1 for spring return</p>\n<p>All students must then submit required supporting materials (set forth in writing at the time the leave was taken) to these offices by the designated dates:</p>\n<p>Suspension Academic Advising May 15 for fall</p>\n<p>Dec 1 for spring</p>\n<p>All other leaves Counseling &amp; Health June 1 for fall</p>\n<p>December 1 for spring</p></div> <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>", "Policy_ID": "19cbf95d-714e-4652-a33a-47c1808bb53c", "Policy_Type": "Academic"}, {"Title": "Payment Plans", "Content": "<div class=\"gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right\">\n<div class=\"gb-c-longform\"><p>The College offers an interest free optional monthly payment plan by semester through GBURG Billing for those who wish to make installment payments over a 5 month period.

This term of Alcohol and Drug Required Leave will be invoked for significant or repeated violations of the terms of the College\u2019s Alcohol and Drug Policy Points System.</p>\n<p>The Vice President for College Life and Dean of Students or their designee will determine the terms of the Alcohol and Drug Required Leave. Generally, students will be on AOD Leave for the remainder of the current semester of the incident plus the full subsequent semester.

In order for us to get the best picture of your college preparation, we also ask that you submit the following with your application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A transcript from a reputable home-school      correspondence program, or a detailed roster (including      subject areas studied, texts used, and time spent on each discipline) of academic coursework      at the secondary level. Classes taken during the senior year at      a local two or four year college or university is highly valued and      transcripts should be included with the application.</li>\n<li>A short narrative, written by the person other than      yourself who has been most responsible for your academic life, describing      the nature of your secondary-level education. This document should      not be a recommendation, but rather a description of your instruction in      recent years.</li>\n<li>In addition to the admissions essay, a graded paper in an academic area of your      choosing is required.</li>\n<li>A letter      of reference from a tutor, evaluator, or teacher who is not a family      member.</li>\n<li>SAT      and/or Act scores are recommended. We      strongly recommend that home-schooled students submit three SAT II subject      tests, preferably in writing, mathematics, and a third subject of the      student's choosing.</li>\n<li>An      interview with an admissions counselor is required.</li>\n</ul></div> <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>", "Policy_ID": "996bf37c-6c57-4436-8f72-ee6b2eb2d3a0", "Policy_Type": "Admissions"}, {"Title": "Honor Societies", "Content": "<div class=\"gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right\">\n<div class=\"gb-c-longform\"><p><h3>Phi Beta Kappa</h3>\n<p>Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, is the oldest Greek-letter society in America and exists to promote liberal learning, to recognize academic excellence, and to support and encourage scholars in their work.

Such persons give  promise of possessing the ability and the motivation that will enable them to  profit from the many opportunities that Gettysburg College offers.</p>\n<p>Since admission is highly competitive, the admission staff gives careful consideration to each application. Its decisions are based on two categories of evidence described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Evidence of high academic achievement as indicated by the secondary school record.</strong> <br/>Gettysburg College considers grades in academic courses, quality and distribution of subjects, and rank in class as highly significant parts of the applicant's credentials. Participation in accelerated, enriched, honors, International Baccalaureate and advanced placement courses is highly desirable. The College regards superior facility in the use of the English language and an understanding of fundamental mathematical processes as essential to a successful college experience.</p>\n<p>It also assumes graduation from an approved secondary school or home-school program.</p>\n<p>Students also must submit the SAT I of the College Board or the test results of the American College Testing (ACT) program. Strong applicants who believe that standardized tests do not represent their academic achievement can choose to apply testing-optional.</p>\n<p><strong>Evidence of personal qualities. <br/></strong>There is high interest in individuals of character who will contribute in positive ways to the College community. In estimating such qualities, the admissions staff relies on what students say about themselves in essays and interviews, and the confidential statements from secondary school principals, headmasters, teachers, and guidance counselors; Essentially, any evidence of in-depth involvement in secondary school activities and/or participation in community affairs is favorably considered in the admission process.</p>\n<p>All acceptances by Gettysburg College are conditional and dependent upon students continuing to do satisfactory work in all subjects, avoiding disciplinary circumstances, and earning a secondary school diploma</p></div> <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>", "Policy_ID": "bdad8857-f2c5-4715-baa2-14c930508e79", "Policy_Type": "Admissions"}, {"Title": "Enrollment Deposit", "Content": "<div class=\"gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right\">\n<div class=\"gb-c-longform\"><p>A $500 enrollment deposit is payable by all students prior to enrollment or readmission following a withdrawal.

Students completing a minor in Educational Studies are well prepared to pursue teaching in graduate school or through alternative licensure programs after leaving Gettysburg, and are also well prepared to explore other opportunities in the field of education after graduation.</p>\n<p>The minor is also designed to engage students in social policy issues related to education and to help students become more informed citizens by developing their understanding of the complexity of education as both a formal process and as a cultural phenomenon. The exact program of study for each minor is designed in consultation with a faculty advisor and includes six courses typically organized around a thematic core.</p>\n<h3><strong>Guidelines &amp; Requirements for the Minor in Educational Studies</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>An introductory course in education: Education 199 or Education 201</li>\n<li>Two courses at the advanced (300) level or higher</li>\n<li>Three additional electives</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also note that one approved course taken off campus may be counted toward the minor, and no more than two courses may be taken at the introductory (100) level. At least four courses must be taken in the Education Department or carry an EDUC prefix.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Education Project<br/></strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to the required six courses that all students completing the minor must take, minors are also strongly encouraged to complete a self-designed applied project or research project in education. The Education Department is committed to working closely with the Center for Public Service to help students become immersed in the local community in an effort to make a difference in the lives of local residents, and several courses offered by the faculty of the department include field-based components that allow students to explore any of a number of different ideas and issues in a variety of educational settings. In the past students have been actively involved in local schools, have helped tutor English language learners at El Centro, have volunteered at the local YWCA, and have been involved in other programs on and off campus that have helped them make an impact on the education of kids in the Gettysburg community. These kinds of projects are strongly encouraged, as are more formal research projects, some of which may even be taken for course credit (students should discuss such options with an Education Advisor).<br/><br/>Students who wish to receive course credit for their projects may consider applying for internship or independent study credit. Students are also encouraged to present their research at Celebration or in other such venues. Students completing an Education Project will also be recognized at the department\u2019s Capstone Presentation event.</p>\n<h3><strong>Program Approval</strong></h3>\n<p>Courses that are included in the minor program of study must have a substantial focus on education as a formal process or on issues related to education. Each student's program must be approved by the Education Department. To get started, students should visit the Education office in 106 Weidensall, or contact any faculty member in the department. Ultimately each prospective minor will need to obtain a signed green form declaring the minor with the Registrar and will also need to provide his or her Education Advisor with a list of the six courses to be included in your minor.

Furthermore, \u201cWriting the Review\u201d treats the review as a significant literary genre. As such, it has a heavy reading component; students will be introduced to the long history of the review and exposed to a broad range of contemporary reviewing platforms and publications, ranging from the Times Literary Supplement (TLS) to Avidly. In addition to writing reviews, they will write papers about the reviews they have read.

Placing the Anglo-Saxon epic in the context of ancient Germanic legend, folklore, and myth, this course helps students to understand the literary geography of the poem, as well as giving them the tools to navigate this topography by introducing them to the rudiments of manuscript study and the Old English language.  Beowulf is well-known to students of English literature everywhere and even the manuscript itself is now readily available through the Electronic Beowulf project. Less familiar, though, are the sites of the epic. The location of the great hall of Heorot has long been postulated to have been somewhere in the vicinity of Roskilde in Denmark. For generations no physical evidence seemed likely to corroborate such suppositions, but recent discoveries at Lejre have reinvigorated this investigation. Archaeological work now is allowing us to place the poem in a physical geography; this opens up more fully our understanding of the world which produced the poem.

The genre of the Medieval Romance had its earliest vernacular genesis in French and Anglo-Norman translations of Latin epic poetry, and eventually it evolved into an extremely popular courtly narrative aimed at a secular aristocratic audience. Because of these origins and aims we might expect Romances to deal with the interests and values of the courtly class, and this is indeed often the case: Spectacles of battles, tournaments, feasts, quests, and the hunt abound, along with elaborate descriptions of clothes, arms, armor, and rituals, most notably those related to \u201ccourtesy,\u201d or polite courtly behavior. Perhaps the most well-known conventions of the Medieval Romance to modern readers are those of courtly love and \u201cchivalry,\u201d the code of knightly virtue and conduct. These are indeed common facets of the genre, and often Romances in fact might be said to articulate and to validate the cultural values and practices of the elite classes of the Medieval West. The Romance is much more than a mere series of re-assertions of fundamental interests and principles, however, and often it critiques the very cultures it seems designed to laud.

Additional topics of discussion will include Afro-pessimism, Afro-optimism, utopia, futurity, blackness, and metaphysics.\n\t\t\t"}, {"Code": "ENG-365", "Course": "Magical Realism Across Continents", "Content": "\n\t\t\t\tAdvanced course exploring magical realism as an international literary artform that emerges amid historic struggles for national autonomy in the global South.

In fact, the discourse of the human emerges precisely because a declaration of universal rights failed to emerge consistently across racial and legal lines after the French and American revolutions. Thinkers like Hannah Arendt, Giorgio Agamben, and Joseph Slaughter have shown that human rights as a field has often been marked by a structural interdependence on the state, the corporation, or, indeed, the market. This course asks how literary representations of human rights in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries raise important questions about empathy, violence, torture, citizenship, and security. By blending literature with political theory, the course explores key human rights figures such as the migrant, the detainee, the refugee, and the undocumented through novels, short stories, and graphic novels from Kashmir, Palestine, Sri Lanka, Botswana, Guant\u00e1namo and the US, and Australia\u2019s Manus Island.\n\t\t\t"}, {"Code": "ENG-367", "Course": "James Baldwin in Fiction and Essays", "Content": "\n\t\t\t\tOver the course of the semester, we will explore the literary output of one of the 20th Century\u2019s most prolific writers, James Baldwin.

Students choose either a Bachelor\u2019s of Arts degree (BA) or a Bachelor\u2019s of Science degree (BS), and pursue an in-depth area of concentration. It is strongly recommended that upon declaring of the ES Major, students develop an ES major plan in consultation with an ES advisor. The plan should include a brief outline of future courses, internships, off-campus study, and independent research. While the plan may change, it encourages students to think intentionally about their academic careers and better prepare them to take full advantage of the learning opportunities available both on and off campus. Graduate schools often require particular coursework for admission, so students considering graduate school should speak with their ES advisors as early as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Curriculum</strong></p>\n<p>Environmental studies majors, both BA and BS, take six core courses. Students typically take ES196 in their first year, and complete the 200-level core courses (211, 223, 225, and 230) by the end of the sophomore year.

Students may also define other regions for study, provided that the proposed curriculum and rationale are approved.</p>\n<p>One of the three courses should focus on some historical aspect of the region in question and one course on some aspect of society and culture in the region. The courses that make up the regional track must draw from at least two disciplines. As part of the process of declaring the globalization studies major, students are asked to provide a rationale for their choice of regional track. The courses for the regional track must be taken at the 200 level and above, with at least one course at the 300 level or higher. Finally, students should complete the College's foreign language requirement in a language appropriate to the region on which they have chosen to focus plus one additional year of language. See language requirements below.</p>\n<p> <strong>Thematic track </strong></p>\n<p>The major requires three courses with a thematic focus. The purpose of these courses is for students to gain in-depth knowledge of some substantive area of globalization studies that combines different disciplines. The courses that make up the thematic track must draw from at least two disciplines. As part of the process of declaring the globalization studies major, students are asked to provide a rationale for their choice of thematic track and must demonstrate a link between their thematic track and methods course. The courses for the thematic track must be taken at the 200 level and above, with at least one course at the 300 level or higher.</p>\n<p> <strong>Capstone/Senior Seminar  </strong></p>\n<p>Students take an interdisciplinary capstone seminar, GS 440, during the spring of their senior year. The seminar, offered by faculty teaching in the globalization studies program, requires students to conduct research on some challenge currently facing the global system. Majors must earn a minimum grade of C-. Students must complete the methods course and off-campus study before enrolling in the capstone.</p>\n<p>GS 440: An intensive seminar experience in which students in the final semester of their GS major will have an opportunity to interact, learn, and bond as a cohort. The capstone will meet once a week for 2.5 hours, during which time students will undertake a common core of coursework related to Globalization as an interdisciplinary field of study. A major objective of the capstone is the completion of an individual capstone project or thesis which reflects a synthesis of the student's regional studies, thematic tracks, study abroad experience, and capstone-related independent research. Students are expected to present their work in a public forum.</p>\n<p> <strong>Study Abroad or other off-campus study </strong></p>\n<p>Globalization Studies majors are required to spend at least one semester <a href=\"/academic-programs/globalization-studies/study-abroad/\">studying abroad</a> or participating in some other off-campus program, such as the Washington, D.C., semester programs offered through American University and Lutheran College.\u00a0 Students should select a program that complements the Regional Track of their major.</p>\n<p> <strong>Language Requirements for GS Majors </strong></p>\n<p>All GS majors graduating in 2014 or later must also take four foreign language courses. The first two courses are required to meet the college's language requirement. The next two courses can be in the same language or in one or two additional language(s). These can be taken on campus or off campus. Half-credit language courses, such as those offered by SIT in less-commonly taught languages, will count. Languages should be appropriate to the regional track.</p>\n<p> <strong>For Those Planning to Double Major </strong></p>\n<p>Students who declare a major in addition to the globalization studies major may count up to three courses from their other major toward the requirements for the globalization studies major.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"Subject": "Health Sciences", "Major": true, "Minor": false, "Brief": "<p class=\"gb-u-type-p\">The <a href=\"/academic-programs/pre-health/\">Pre-Health Professions</a> program helps students meet the challenges of planning for and applying to medical school and other graduate programs in the health professions.</p>", "Courses": [{"Code": "HS-120", "Course": "Public Health", "Content": "\n\t\t\t\tThis course introduces students to the core disciplines of public health including epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, social and behavioral sciences, and health policy.

The perpetrator had made Jewhating statements on social media before the attack. (Many of us in Jewish Studies no longer use the word antisemitism, but Jew-hatred. The word \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 was coined by a Jew hating man named Wilhelm Mahr in 29th century Germany. We thus now identify antisemitism for what it is, hatred of Jews.) Globally, some commentators have observed a resurgence of Jew-hatred over the past two decades. Attempts by policy-makers and activists to identify and combat Jew-hatred, whether on the streets of urban centers, across social media spaces, or in college dormitories, are often hobbled by a lack of knowledge about the history of the phenomenon.

The individualized major program is for students who want to chart a truly original path through the Gettysburg Curriculum by designing their own course of study.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-apply\">How to Apply</h2>\n<p>To create an individualized major, you must develop a concept that is focused on a problem, question, or area of investigation of special interest, and that cannot be adequately addressed within a single department or discipline, or by an existing major at the college. You must <a href=\"/academic-programs/interdisciplinary-studies/programs/individualized-major/forms\">submit an application</a> to the Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) Committee explaining your concept and proposing the courses through which you will explore it. Faculty sponsors (from two separate departments) will work with you to help you polish your application and will advise and guide you through your course of study.</p>\n<p>Your individualized major must be an integrated plan of study that incorporates coursework from a minimum of two departments or fields.

Failure to earn a minimum grade of C in their designated Methods course requires a withdrawal from the individualized major.</p>\n<h2 id=\"capstone-requirements\">Capstone Requirements</h2>\n<p>The individualized major Capstone (IDS 464) must be worked out with a student\u2019s faculty advisors. A <a href=\"/academic-programs/interdisciplinary-studies/programs/individualized-major/forms\">capstone application form</a> must be submitted to and approved by the IDS Committee by the end of a student\u2019s junior year (or by the end of the fall semester if studying abroad during the spring of their junior year). Since your proposal must be approved before you can register for IDS 464, the lack of an approved capstone proposal constitutes a lack of a graduation plan, which is reason to delay your graduation date. A capstone cannot be conducted in the same semester that it is approved.</p>\n<p>A student may graduate with Honors with an individualized major. Honors designation requires a high GPA (as calculated at the end of the seventh semester), the endorsement of both faculty advisors, and a 464 Capstone project that is deemed to be outstanding by the capstone supervisor when the IDS Committee is ready to request an evaluation.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"Subject": "International Affairs", "Major": true, "Minor": false, "Brief": "None",

For writers, the concept of space, gender, race, and class--as well as intersections and borderlands--play an important role when depicting Latin American women\u2019s\u2019 representation and Latina women in the United States and their experiences. We will use a comparative analysis utilizing texts from Latina and Latin American women writers to look feminist discourse across physical, geographic or abstract borders. The concept of space as an analytical tool will facilitate our textual analysis, and will serve to establish a common ground to discuss similarities and difference regarding women\u2019s identity and their condition in Latin America and the United States.

Although the fundamentals of business and management are still relevant, the ever-changing environment of business, globalization, and the impact on society requires a more fluid and analytical understanding. The Department of Management encourages students to use the skills and knowledge they will gain to analyze contemporary issues in a critical manner that is unfettered by traditional frameworks. Workers, communities, and social justice are given equal consideration with profit and shareholder returns. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Business, Organizations, and Management major is anchored in the social sciences, and reaffirms the central role of the liberal arts in studies of business, organizations, and management. Critical thinking, rigorous inquiry, and the acquisition of knowledge are central to the Business, Organizations, and Management major. The curriculum stresses intellectual boldness, creative problem solving, entrepreneurial thinking, and the practice of socially responsible management. It is an ideal major for anyone aspiring to a management or leadership position in business, government, the nonprofit sector, or any other organizational environment. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Business, Organizations, and Management major is designed to give students not only a solid grounding in core principles of business, but to do so within a framework that extends beyond traditional pedagogical views for studying and teaching business. Students will rely on a critical managerial perspective for understanding and analyzing the evolving relationships of businesses with local, national, and global constituencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Students who major in Business, Organizations, and Management will take microeconomics, accounting, organizational behavior, statistics, research methods, marketing, and ethics. Business, Organizations, and Management majors will also have the opportunity to explore the critical analysis of corporate finance, marketing, business law, entrepreneurship, small business management, and business policy and strategy. In addition, they can choose to critically study the complex relationships among individuals, policies, and structures within business and organizations through courses on organization theory, systems thinking, decision making, as well as topics related to the future of work, organizational culture, human resource management, leadership, employee motivation, and well-being. \n</p>\n<h2 id=\"critical-action-learning\">\n\tCritical Action-Learning Experience\n</h2>\n<p>\n\tIncorporated into the Capstone class.

The department uses both normative and empirical methodologies to examine political issues in all of the subfields, and a principal goal of the department is to teach students how to think analytically, write clearly and persuasively, and be inquisitive and imaginative as they contend with these issues.</p>\n<p>The College\u2019s location gives students an excellent historical vantage point from which to ponder contemporary political questions.

The <a href=\"/academic-programs/political-science/pdfs/2019/PoliticalScienceCoursesbySubfield2015-2018.pdf\">courses are categorized in four general subfields</a> (PDF) of the discipline: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Political Theory. Students take three introductory courses, two 200 and two 300 level courses, an elective at the 200 or 300 level, the methods course, and the capstone.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductory Courses:</strong> Majors are required to take three of the four introductory courses. The options are: Political Science 101 American Government; 102, Introduction to Political Theory; 103 Introduction to International Relations; or 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics. Courses at this level introduce students to the core set of themes that define Political Science including the manner in which they are conceptualized by the particular subfield.  The 100-level courses may be taken in any order, and should be completed by the end of the sophomore year. Occasionally, certain First Year Seminars offered by members of the department may be used to satisfy one of the introductory courses. Students should consult their First Year Seminar instructors to see if their seminar is applicable. Introductory courses are prerequisites for all advanced courses. Students who submit an AP score of 4 or 5 in American Government may receive course credit for POL 101. Course credit for advanced placement will be lost if a student takes POL 101 at Gettysburg.</p>\n<p><strong>Political Science Methods:</strong> All students must take Political Science 215, Political Science Research Methods, as sophomores or first-semester juniors. Starting with the Fall Term 2012, students must earn a grade of C (2.0) or better in POL 215 to graduate with a major in political science.</p>\n<p><strong>Subfield Specialization: 200 level courses: </strong>Courses at this level explore key themes and related issues in greater depth. Students learn about the research process and how to pursue their own research questions. All students must choose two subfields from the three represented in their introductory courses. All students must take at least one 200 level course in each of these subfields.</p>\n<p><strong>Subfield Specialization: 300 level courses:</strong> At this level students engage in a critical and deeper examination of specific topics that exemplify the core set of themes of importance to political scientists. All students must follow up the 200 level courses with at least one 300 level course in each of their selected subfields.</p>\n<p><strong>Elective:</strong> Students may fulfill the elective requirement by taking either a 200 or 300 level course in one of the three subfields taken at the introductory level.</p>\n<p><strong>Capstone:</strong> The capstone course serves as the culmination of the communication conventions in the discipline. Students will be immersed in a specific area of scholarship, will read, analyze and finally produce research relevant to the topic of the course. All seniors must enroll in a senior capstone course. The course must be in one of the two subfields pursued in the major. Capstone seminars in American Politics, International Relations, and Comparative Politics will be offered every year. The capstone in Political Theory will be offered every other year. Students who are unable to take the Political Theory capstone in their senior year may enroll in it in their junior year.</p>\n<p><strong>Honors:</strong> Majors will receive Honors in Political Science if they maintain a 3.67 grade point average in the major and complete the senior capstone with a 4.00 (A) grade.</p>\n<p><strong>Off Campus Courses:</strong> Students are encouraged to pursue off campus programs. Political Science course credit will be given to those courses that are consistent with the department\u2019s subfield designations. Political science courses taken off campus will satisfy 200-level requirements only, and only two political science courses taken off campus can satisfy major requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Internships: </strong>Students are encouraged to take internships for academic course credit, but they are graded S/U and do not fulfill any major requirements. Students need to work with the Center for Career Development and consult with a faculty member on the nature of the internship and its academic requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Individualized Study: </strong>Individualized study provides an excellent opportunity for students to work with a faculty member on an important political topic and produce a significant research paper. Students need to consult with a faculty member on choosing the topic and arranging the requirements of the course. Individualized Study is graded A-F, is calculated in the major grade point average, but does not fulfill any major requirements.</p>\n<h2>The Minor in Political Science</h2>\n<p>Students intending to minor in political science need to understand the subfield orientation of the minor as well as the minor requirements. Prof. Roy Dawes is the department advisor for the minor and students should consult with him on choosing courses to fulfill the minor requirements. At this time, students should formally declare the minor.  Prof. Dawes will sign their minor declaration form which they will then turn in to the Registrar\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>The minor in political science consists of six courses in political science. All minors specialize in two of the four subfields in political science; therefore, they should give considerable thought to which subfields they pursue as they complete the minor.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor requirements:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Introductory Courses:</strong> Minors are required to take two of the four introductory courses. The options are: Political Science 101 American Government; 102, Introduction to Political Theory; 103 Introduction to International Relations; or 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Courses:</strong> Minors are required to take four courses at the 200 or 300 level that are consistent with the subfields chosen at the introductory level. These courses cannot all fall in the same subfield. The usual sequence of courses is two courses in each subfield but some students take three in one and one in the other. Students may substitute POL 215 Political Research Methods for one of these courses.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"Subject": " Pre-Health Professions ", "Major": null, "Minor": null}, {"Subject": "Psychology", "Major": true, "Minor": true, "Brief": "None", "Courses": [{"Code": "PSYCH-101", "Course": "Introduction to Psychology", "Content": "\n\t\t\t\tIntroduction to basic scientific logic, facts, theories, and principles of psychology, including topics such as human motivation, learning, emotion, perception, thought, intelligence, and personality.\n\t\t\t"}, {"Code": "PSYCH-205", "Course": "Introduction to Statistics", "Content": "\n\t\t\t\tIntroduction to descriptive and inferential statistical methods with applications in psychology.
