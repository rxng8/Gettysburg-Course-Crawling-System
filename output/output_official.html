<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>The normal program consists of eight courses per year, with four courses in each semester. (Thus, a student will complete graduation requirements in four years of full-time academic work in the September-through-May academic year.) A minimum of sixteen course units must be taken at Gettysburg College or in an approved College program. The last full year of academic work must be completed as a full-time student. Unless given approval, students may not complete requirements as part-time students during their last semester of residence.</p>
<p>Students proposing to complete graduation requirements in less than four full years must have their programs approved by the Academic Standing Committee through the Office of the Registrar. Such approval should be sought at least a year before the proposed completion of requirements.</p>
<p>A full-time student for academic purposes is one carrying a minimum of three courses during a semester. No student who is a candidate for a degree may take fewer courses than this without permission of the Academic Standing Committee.</p>
<p>After the first semester, students may enroll in five courses in any two semesters without petitioning for the right to do so; after two such five course unit enrollments, students will have to petition to overload. For the purposes of determining a full load of four courses, summer internship credit recorded in a subsequent semester will not count. The four course load will apply to study abroad programs. In all cases, students will be allowed to pre-register for only four one-unit courses, and those eligible for an overload may add a fifth course unit during the start-of-term registration period.</p>
<p>Majors and minors in music must take quarter courses, in addition to the normal course load. Other students may take quarter courses in applied music, with the approval of the music department at an additional charge.</p>
<p>A student may audit informally any College course with the permission of the instructor. No charge will be made for such an audit and no record of auditing will appear on the student's transcript.</p>
<p>The College offers a limited opportunity for students to register for and complete a course of study during the summer. Primarily these are off-campus individualized study or internship courses and are arranged through academic departments.</p></div> <p> </p>

            <h2>Class Attendance General Policies and Policies for Athletics & Other Extracurricular Activities</h2>
            <div class="gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right">
<div class="gb-c-longform"><h2><em>From Faculty Handbook, 2005 Edition</em></h2>
<p>“At the heart of Gettysburg College,” insists the College’s Statement of Purpose “is the academic program.” Commitments to the academic program take priority over other College activities. But, the College also offers students the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities because it believes that these activities can make important contributions to their education as whole persons. The following statement describes the appropriate relationship between academic and extracurricular activities.</p>
<h2><strong>Gettysburg College’s Policy on Class Attendance and Absence</strong></h2>
<p>The College recognizes that regular attendance at all classes is an essential part of its academic purpose and clearly is the responsibility of the individual student. Each student is accountable for all work missed because of absences from class, and instructors are under no obligation to make special arrangements for students who are absent from classes. Instructors must explain their individual or departmental attendance policy during the first class meeting and/or in their course outlines.</p>
<p>Class absences will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis by the instructor of the course. There is no such thing as an “officially excused” absence from a class at Gettysburg College. If a student will miss class for any reason (for example, religious observances, college trips, family emergencies, or illness), students must discuss this absence with their instructor in advance whenever possible. The student will be ultimately responsible for making up any missed work; however, in some cases, it may not be possible to make up missed work. When students are seen in the Health Center, they are provided documentation of each appointment, and they can share this documentation with faculty if needed.</p>
<p>If you must miss class, we encourage you to notify your professors as soon as possible with as much information as you can provide about the date of your anticipated absence, the reasons, and your plan for making up any missed work. Students should ask the professor to let them know if they have any questions about the absence or any instructions to give about making up the missed work. Students should include in any written or e-mail message their campus box number, telephone number, and e-mail address.</p>
<p><strong>On occasion, even if absences are due to documented medical or emergency situations, students may miss so much class that they are not able to meet the goals of the course. In these cases, students may be advised to withdraw from the course.</strong></p>
<p>A student who receives an Excessive Absence Warning through the online Progress/Midterm Deficiency Report system is being formally notified that an instructor has warned the student about excessive absence in the course and that further absence may result in the student being required to withdraw from the course.</p>
<p>Academic Advising may notify faculty of certain student absences, by request, if the student is unable to notify faculty directly. Health Services does not write notes for students but will contact Academic Advising about student visits or certain diagnoses at a student’s request. These notifications are not to be construed as “official excuses” sanctioned by Academic Advising; individual faculty are far better suited to assess the legitimacy of students’ explanations for absence than is the Academic Advising office. Academic Advising does not notify faculty of sports or college related absences.</p>
<h2><strong>Practice and Activities Times</strong></h2>
<p>The period from 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Monday through Friday has traditionally been set aside for athletic practices and other extra-curricular activities. It is intended that activities such as band, choir, theatre productions, community service activities, and athletic practices will ordinarily take place during this time without conflict with scheduled classes or with other academic obligations, including make-up tests.</p>
<p>It is a violation of NCAA regulations for a coach to require an athlete to attend a practice that conflicts with a class. Therefore, no student will be expected to miss a class or leave class early in order to be at practice.</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially early in the second semester, indoor athletic practices must be scheduled. Because the College lacks sufficient space for all teams to practice indoors between 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., practices will occasionally meet at other times. No practice scheduled at a time other than 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. can be made mandatory for athletes. If such a practice conflicts with an assigned academic activity, the academic activity must take precedence. Apart from the condition just specified, no formal or informal team practices, training sessions, etc. should be scheduled at times other than 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>It is especially important that faculty let students know if testing; review sessions, extra classes, etc. will be scheduled in the 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. period. Faculty members should make every effort to avoid the situation where the only opportunity for a student to make up a test or complete some other required activity occurs between 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>An administrator from the College Life Division shall act as a liaison between students, faculty, coaches, and advisors of extra-curricular organizations should complaints or misunderstandings arise concerning the implementation of this policy. It will be the responsibility of coaches and advisors of extra-curricular activities to be sure that all students involved in athletics and these activities are aware of this person and his or her function.</p>
<h2><strong>Absences Due to Athletic Contests or Other Extracurricular Activities </strong></h2>
<p>As noted in the College’s Policy on Class Attendance, it is the student’s responsibility to request permission from faculty members to miss class because of a scheduled event and to make arrangements with the faculty members to make up any work missed because of an athletic contest or other extracurricular activity. If the level of anticipated absences is so high that the student may have problems in reasonably meeting the requirements of the course for class attendance and other matters, the student has the responsibility of determining whether or not it is possible for him or her to continue to participate in that extracurricular activity. If it is not possible to continue to participate in the extracurricular activity and still meet the requirements of the class, the student must decide whether to withdraw from the activity or, in certain circumstances, to postpone the class to a later semester.</p>
<p>If, for any reason, (including injury or disciplinary sanction by a coach), a student will not be playing in an away game and this is known before the team leaves for the game, a student should be so informed and not be required to travel with the team. Coaches will encourage students who will not be playing in a contest (where the trip to the contest requires them to miss a class) to attend class rather than miss the class.</p></div> <p> </p>

            <h2>Grading System</h2>
            <div class="gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right">
<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>Courses are normally graded A through F, with these grades having the following significance:<br/>A (excellent); B (good); C (fair); D (poor); and F (failing). Instructors may modify their letter grades with plus and minus signs.</p>
<p>In successfully completing a course under this grading system, a student earns a number of quality points according to the following scale.</p>
<div class="gb-c-table-responsive">
<div class="gb-c-table">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A+</td>
<td>4.33</td>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p>A student's accumulative average is computed by summing his or her quality points and dividing by the number of course units taken. The average is rounded to the second decimal place.</p>
<p>The College reserves the right to make changes and adjustments in the grading system even after a student enrolls.</p>
<p>The College offers a satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading option. This option is intended to encourage students to be adventurous intellectually in courses with subject matter or approaches substantially different from their prior academic experience or attainment. An S signifies satisfactory work, and is given if a student performs at the C- level or higher; a U signifies unsatisfactory work, and is given for work below the C- level. Courses graded S/U do not affect a student's quality point average, but a course completed with an S grade will count toward the total number of courses needed for graduation. A student may elect to take a total of six courses on an S/U basis during his or her four years at Gettysburg College; however, no more than two S/U courses may be taken in any one year. This grading option may not be selected for requirements for graduation, or for courses taken in a student's major field. Exceptions may be made with regard to the major in cases where a department specifies that a particular course is available under the S/U grading system only, and in cases where the student declares the major after taking the course. A student must choose the S/U grading option during the first ten class days of the semester.</p>
<p>Students who enroll in Education 476: Student Teaching may take an additional course under the S/U option during the senior year, provided that their total number of S/U courses does not exceed six.</p>
<p>When a student registers for and completes a course which he or she has already taken at Gettysburg College, both the credit and the grade previously earned are canceled, but they are not removed from the permanent record. The credit and grade earned in repeating the course are counted toward the student's requirements.</p>
<p>A grade of Inc (Incomplete) is issued through the Office of Academic Advising when emergency situations, such as illness, prevent a student from completing the course requirements on time. The missing work must be completed by the end of the add/drop deadline of the semester following the one in which the incomplete was incurred.</p>
<p>A student who withdraws officially from a course after the ten-day add/drop period, but within the first eleven weeks of the term, receives a W (withdrew) grade. If a student withdraws from a course during the last five weeks of the semester, he or she will receive an F (failure) in the course. A student who withdraws officially for medical reasons receives a W regardless of the time of withdrawal. The W grade is not used in computing averages.</p>
<p>The symbol N/F is used in cases where a student registers for a course but does not attend or participate in the course and then fails to withdraw properly. It is assigned 0 quality points and is used in the GPA.</p></div> <p> </p>

            <h2>Suspension, Leaves of Absence, and Reinstatement</h2>
            <div class="gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right">
<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>Students are expected to be enrolled continuously from their matriculation through graduation. Understanding that unexpected events may occur, however, the College allows for leaves of absence. If a student withdraws from a course during the last five weeks of the semester, the student will receive an F (failure) in the course unless granted a withdrawal for approved medical reasons. </p>
<p>For enrollment accounting purposes, all students will be withdrawn after 180 days from the last day of class attendance. Students who have been suspended, placed on leave, or withdrawn do not have to reapply for admission to the College, but they may be required to submit information for review and approval before being reinstated. Any such requirements will be set forth when the suspension or leave is initiated. Students may also voluntarily, permanently withdraw from the College.</p>
<p>Students who have been suspended, placed on leave, or withdrawn may not remain on campus, may not participate in College activities, and may not visit campus.</p>
<p>Gettysburg College reserves the right to initiate or require a leave or suspension for academic, disciplinary, medical, or behavioral reasons and reserves the right to defer or refuse reinstatement or return.</p>
<p>Suspensions <br/> A student may be suspended for academic or disciplinary reasons. Please refer to the College policy on Academic Standing for additional information on academic related suspensions or the Student Code of Conduct for additional information on disciplinary related suspensions. At the time of suspension, the student will be notified of the semester that the student may be eligible for readmission to the College. A student academically suspended for a second time is not eligible for readmission.</p>
<h2>Leaves of Absence</h2>
<p>The College has three types of leaves of absence: Personal, Medical, and Behavioral (College-Initiated). All leaves are administered through the Office of Academic Advising. To initiate a leave of absence, a student must submit a leave of absence request form to the Office of Academic Advising. A student who is on leave may petition the Academic Standing Committee to transfer credit for courses taken at another institution. Proposals for such study <strong>must</strong> be submitted in advance to the Registrar for review by the Academic Standing Committee. All leaves will be refunded in accordance with the College’s refund schedule. For further details about regulations and policies, consult the Academic Advising website. For information about refunding of tuition and fees, please consult Student Accounts or the <a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/academic-programs/curriculum/catalog/policies/policy-details?id=c3e7a2e9-dff2-4da0-b770-01574e81aa56">Withdrawal and Leave of Absence Refund Policy.</a></p>
<p>1) Personal Leave. A student may request a Personal Leave at any time. If the College has information to suggest that a Medical Leave is appropriate, however, the College may refer the request to Health and Counseling for review and recommendations. At its discretion, the College may transmute a Personal Leave into a Medical Leave.</p>
<p>2) Medical Leave. Medical Leave requires the support and approval of Health or Counseling Services. All applications for medical leave are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Students who are hospitalized during the semester require approval from Health or Counseling before being allowed to return to campus. Students may be advised to take a health leave following hospitalization, pending review on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Students who are granted a Medical Leave are expected to be on leave for any remainder of the current semester and for the subsequent semester. Students who are granted late course withdrawals from some but not all courses are generally expected to take a Medical Leave for the subsequent semester.</p>
<p>3) Behavioral Leave (College Initiated). The College will apply the procedures outlined in this policy to determine, at its discretion, whether a Behavioral Leave is necessary. Behavioral Leave generally carries the expectation that: a) student is withdrawn for the remainder of the current semester and the subsequent semester; and, b) completes associated requirements before being allowed to return to campus. Students are normally encouraged to consider a voluntary leave before the College initiates a Behavioral Leave. The College may implement Interim Measures (see “Interim Measures” below) during this process. Alcohol and Other Drugs leaves are addressed separately in the Student Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>The College may initiate a Behavioral Leave if, in the judgment of the Dean of Students’ Office, the student meets one or more of the following standards:</p>
<ol>
<li>The student’s behavior compromises the health and safety of self or others. This may include behavior that necessitates unreasonable measures to ensure the student’s and/or others’ wellbeing.</li>
<li>The student’s behavior is disruptive to others. This includes behavior that causes emotional, psychological or physical distress substantially above that normally experienced in daily life or that disrupts College operations.</li>
<li>The student fails to comply with an assessment, intervention or Medical Leave recommended by the College because of academic, medical, or behavioral concerns. Where the recommended assessment is impossible, as with the student’s failure to comply, indirect behavioral observations will constitute the basis for judgment.</li>
<li>The student requires specialized care or interventions to manage behavioral issues that the College cannot reasonably provide.</li>
<li>The student is enrolled but has a pattern of class absences demonstrating failure to maintain their enrollment status (full- or part-time).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Procedures for a Behavioral Leave</h2>
<p>Any individual who believes that a student meets one or more of the standards described above should contact the Dean of Students’ Office, which will refer the matter to an administrator designated as the Coordinator of the student’s case. The Coordinator will appoint other personnel to form a Review Committee, which the Coordinator heads.</p>
<p>The Review Committee may require an assessment of the student by a medical/psychiatric provider on- or off-campus to determine if the student meets the standards above. An assessment is not required in determining whether the standards above have been met, however. The Review Committee will consider all medical, psychological, observational and academic reports submitted with regard to or on behalf of the student that are relevant to determining the appropriateness of a Behavioral Leave. Treatment and evaluation reports should include information pertaining to diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. With the information available, the Review Committee will also determine if a reasonable accommodation can be made to maintain the student’s enrollment.</p>
<p>If the Review Committee concludes that the student does not meet any of the standards for a Behavioral Leave, it will inform the student in writing and this process will terminate. Generally, a member of the Review Committee will meet with the student to consider appropriate alternatives, including a behavioral contract or disciplinary action.</p>
<p>If the Review Committee concludes that the student does meet one or more of the standards for a Behavioral Leave, the Review Committee will notify the student of its decision in writing and will include reasons for its conclusion. The Review Committee’s decision will become effective immediately.</p>
<h2>Appeal Process for a Behavioral Leave</h2>
<p>A decision reached by the Review Committee may be appealed by the student to the Dean of Students’ Office within five (5) calendar days of the decision. Such appeals should be in writing and include specific points the student wishes the Dean of Students’ Office to consider. The Dean of Students’ Office has five (5) calendar days to review the information presented and inform the student of the decision in writing. The Dean of Students’ Office may (1) uphold the decision of the Review Committee, (2) adjust the finding, (3) refer the matter back to the Review Committee for further proceedings, or (4) reverse the decision of the Review Committee and reinstate the student. The appeal decision is final. </p>
<h2>Interim Measures</h2>
<p>To ensure the safety of individual students and the community, the College may take interim measures while working through disciplinary and Behavioral Leave reviews. Interim measures include residential separation or relocation, class schedule changes, restrictions from College activities and/or facilities, work or job assignment changes, “no contact” directives, temporary separation from the College, a health evaluation (see “Health Evaluation” below), or other measures to ensure the well-being of all students.</p>
<h2>Health Evaluations</h2>
<p>Health evaluations must address 1) attendance dates of the evaluation and any previous dates of contact; 2) a description of the evaluation procedures (tests, interviews, etc.); 3) specifics about recommended courses of treatment; 4) an opinion about the fitness of the student to return to residential living OR suggestions for alternative arrangements; 5) an opinion about whether and under what circumstances the student appears to represent a danger to self or others. Based on the information submitted, the Director of Health or Counseling may refer students for additional evaluation if it is determined by the Director that more information is needed to determine eligibility for reinstatement.</p>
<p>Students undergoing health evaluations must sign releases of information that allow 1) their medical/psychiatric providers to communicate with Health and/or Counseling Services; and, 2) Health and/or Counseling Services to communicate information to College Life. Releases are available on the Counseling Services website at <a href="/offices/health-counseling-services/counseling-services/general-releases">https://www.gettysburg.edu/offices/health-counseling-services/counseling-services/general-releases</a></p>
<p>Note that securing a valid health evaluation can take weeks; thus when a health evaluation is required, the student may be advised/required to take a leave.</p>
<h2>Process for Reinstatement after Suspension or Leave</h2>
<p>Students must resolve all incomplete coursework before they will be permitted to return from leave.</p>
<p>Students placed on Suspension or Leave must follow the requirements set forth in writing at the time they left. Failure to do so or to provide accurate and complete information is grounds for denying reinstatement. Return may include stipulations concerning class schedule, extracurricular activities, place of residence or other conditions as may be judged to be in the best interest of the student and the College community. While the College seriously considers the opinions of external individuals (medical providers, e.g.), the ultimate decision about reinstatement belongs to the College. Thus, a recommendation for return from a student’s healthcare provider(s) is not in itself sufficient grounds for reinstatement.</p>
<p>Students may participate in upcoming registration activities after being officially approved for reinstatement.</p>
<p>All students wishing to return from suspension/leave must notify Academic Advising of their intent to return per the following dates:</p>
<p>Notification to Academic Advising</p>
<p>Suspension April 15 for fall return</p>
<p>November 1 for spring return</p>
<p>All other leaves May 1 for fall return</p>
<p>November 1 for spring return</p>
<p>All students must then submit required supporting materials (set forth in writing at the time the leave was taken) to these offices by the designated dates:</p>
<p>Suspension Academic Advising May 15 for fall</p>
<p>Dec 1 for spring</p>
<p>All other leaves Counseling &amp; Health June 1 for fall</p>
<p>December 1 for spring</p></div> <p> </p>

<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>A key component of Gettysburg College’s mission is to provide a safe environment where students are able to pursue their academic and social goals. The College may require a student to take a leave of absence if a student illustrates that they are repeatedly unable to make sound and safe decisions about alcohol and drug use, or the student engages in drinking or drug use that threatens the life, health and safety of one’s self or others. This term of Alcohol and Drug Required Leave will be invoked for significant or repeated violations of the terms of the College’s Alcohol and Drug Policy Points System.</p>
<p>The Vice President for College Life and Dean of Students or their designee will determine the terms of the Alcohol and Drug Required Leave. Generally, students will be on AOD Leave for the remainder of the current semester of the incident plus the full subsequent semester. If a student violates the terms of the Alcohol and Drug Policy Points System by reaching or exceeding ten points, the terms of the Alcohol and Drug Required Leave will normally include a provision for the student to receive care (medical, psychiatric, psychological, counseling, or therapy) while on leave.</p>
<p>Our procedures will follow the protocol outlined in the Medical Leave of Absence and Withdrawal Policy of the Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities. The Vice President for College Life and Dean of Students or their designee may identify additional criteria in order to return to campus. The Vice President for College Life and Dean of Students or their designee, in consultation with Health and Counseling Services, will determine if all criteria have been met and if the student is eligible to return. If a student is required to leave during the fall semester, normally the leave will be extended to the entire spring semester as well.</p>
<p>A student returning from Required Leave will have 5 points on their record upon return.</p>
<p>A student that accumulates 10 or more points for a SECOND time during their Gettysburg career will be referred to the Student Conduct Review Board for consideration of suspension/expulsion, along with any sanctions assigned through the point system process. Instances of any of these behaviors, whether alcohol-related or not, could also be referred to the Student Conduct Review Board for consideration of possible suspension or expulsion (along with other sanctions, as detailed in the Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities).</p></div> <p> </p>

<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>This policy applies to all courses presented for transfer to Gettysburg College except those completed through the Central Pennsylvania Consortium or through an affiliated program administered by the Center for Global Education.</p>
<p>After enrolling at Gettysburg College, students may transfer a maximum of three course credits. Transfer credit may be presented at the time of matriculation. After matriculation, all transfer credit must be pre-approved by the Office of the Registrar. Students entering Gettysburg College as a transfer student must satisfy all additional course requirements and a minimum of 16 course credits at Gettysburg College or through a regular College-approved program of off-campus study.</p>
<p>Credit for academic work completed at another institution may be awarded based upon the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Student must arrange for the transfer institution to send an official transcript to the Gettysburg College Office of the Registrar.</li>
<li>Transfer institutions within the United States must be regionally accredited. Institutions outside of the United States must be recognized as degree granting institutions by their home country. International transcripts may require a third-party evaluation by World Education Services (WES) or the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) International Education Services.</li>
<li>Credit of at least two semester hours or three quarter hours and a grade of C- or better (or its equivalent) must be earned to be eligible for transfer.</li>
<li>Courses must be similar to Gettysburg College courses in content, method of instruction, and rigor. Online, hybrid, distance learning courses: Normally credit is not accepted for courses without regular meeting times, or contact time with the course instructor. Transfer credit for this type of course can be considered on an individual basis only with the support of the appropriate department chair.</li>
</ol>
<p>To insure that a full load under another credit system equates to a full load at Gettysburg College, the following conversion scheme applies to students presenting more than three transfer course credits for evaluation:</p>

<li>Valedictorian - to the senior with the highest accumulative average.</li>
<li>Salutatorian - to the senior with the second highest accumulative average.</li>
<li>Summa Cum Laude - to those seniors who have an accumulative average of 3.90 or higher.</li>
<li>Magna Cum Laude - to those seniors who have an accumulative average of 3.70 through 3.89.</li>
<li>Cum Laude - to those seniors who have an accumulative average of 3.50 through 3.69.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Academic Standing Committee may grant the above honors to students with transfer credit if they have satisfied the conditions of the honor during at least two years in residence at Gettysburg College and have presented excellent transfer grades. To arrive at a decision, the Committee will factor in all grades earned at other institutions and during off-campus study programs.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, departments may award Departmental Honors for graduating seniors based upon their academic performance in a major field of study. Departmental Honors are awarded to transfer students on the same terms as to other students, as computation for this award is not necessarily based on four years in residence at Gettysburg College.</p>

<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>In May of 1957, the Faculty approved in principle an Honor Code and accepted in fact a Constitution for the Honor Code at Gettysburg College. With these measures, the Faculty delegated to the Honor Commission responsibility for the regulation of student academic conduct. The final responsibility for the regulation of student conduct remains with the Faculty. The current version of the Honor Code is the result of substantial revision approved by the Faculty, Honor Commission, and Student Senate in 2006.</p>
<p>The Gettysburg College Honor Code articulates the relationship between our shared values of honesty and integrity and our mission as an institution devoted to learning and the pursuit of knowledge. In short, this mission depends on trust and trust requires honesty and integrity. The entire College community is enjoined to actively support our principles of honesty and integrity as summarized in the Gettysburg College Pledge:</p>
<p>I affirm that I will uphold the highest principles of honesty and integrity in all my endeavors at Gettysburg College and foster an atmosphere of mutual respect within and beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>For information about responsibilities to support the principles of the Honor Code and information about procedures for addressing breaches of the Honor Code, students should consult the full text of the Honor Code and the summary in the next section or at the following website: <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/honorcode">http://www.gettysburg.edu/honorcode</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/></span></p></div> <p> </p>

<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>Students generally maintain an academic record that will enable them to complete the requirements for graduation in the normal eight semesters. To accomplish that goal, a student needs to achieve at least a 2.00 accumulative average, a 2.00 average for the semester, and a 2.00 average in the major field of study by the end of the junior year and during the senior year and to make appropriate progress in acquiring the credits and completing the various requirements for graduation. Students who do not meet these normal standards will be given a warning, placed on academic probation, placed on suspension alert, or, if not making satisfactory progress toward graduation, suspended or dismissed permanently from the College.</p>
<p>The student who falls below the following minimum standard is subject to suspension or permanent dismissal: for the first year-1.50 GPA and six course units completed; for the second year-1.80 GPA and thirteen course units completed; for the third year-1.90 GPA and twenty course units completed; for the fourth year-2.00 GPA and twenty-six course units completed; and for the fifth year-2.00 GPA and thirty-two to thirty-three course units completed. First-year students may be suspended after one semester if their GPA is 1.00 or below.</p>
<p>A student on one of the forms of academic warning listed above is permitted to remain at the College as long as the student is making satisfactory progress toward graduation by removing the academic deficiency during the following semesters. Normally, a student may not remain at the College with three consecutive semester averages below 2.00.</p>
<p>While students on warning, academic probation, or suspension alert are permitted to participate in extracurricular activities at the College, they are reminded that their first priority is the academic program and that they must therefore give careful consideration to time commitments and responsibilities associated with extracurricular activities.</p>

Candidates for admissions who have been educated in the home must interview with an admissions counselor and include with the application both the accrediting and evaluative documentation mandated by their home state. In order for us to get the best picture of your college preparation, we also ask that you submit the following with your application:</p>
<ul>
<li>A transcript from a reputable home-school      correspondence program, or a detailed roster (including      subject areas studied, texts used, and time spent on each discipline) of academic coursework      at the secondary level. Classes taken during the senior year at      a local two or four year college or university is highly valued and      transcripts should be included with the application.</li>
<li>A short narrative, written by the person other than      yourself who has been most responsible for your academic life, describing      the nature of your secondary-level education. This document should      not be a recommendation, but rather a description of your instruction in      recent years.</li>
<li>In addition to the admissions essay, a graded paper in an academic area of your      choosing is required.</li>
<li>A letter      of reference from a tutor, evaluator, or teacher who is not a family      member.</li>
<li>SAT      and/or Act scores are recommended. We      strongly recommend that home-schooled students submit three SAT II subject      tests, preferably in writing, mathematics, and a third subject of the      student's choosing.</li>

            <div class="gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right">
<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>Gettysburg College students come from a wide variety of backgrounds and  secondary school programs. The College encourages applications from students of  differing ethnic, religious, racial, economic, and geographic backgrounds who  have demonstrated a capacity for academic achievement, responsiveness to  intellectual challenge, eagerness to contribute their special talents to the  College community, and an awareness of social responsibility. Such persons give  promise of possessing the ability and the motivation that will enable them to  profit from the many opportunities that Gettysburg College offers.</p>
<p>Since admission is highly competitive, the admission staff gives careful consideration to each application. Its decisions are based on two categories of evidence described below.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence of high academic achievement as indicated by the secondary school record.</strong> <br/>Gettysburg College considers grades in academic courses, quality and distribution of subjects, and rank in class as highly significant parts of the applicant's credentials. Participation in accelerated, enriched, honors, International Baccalaureate and advanced placement courses is highly desirable. The College regards superior facility in the use of the English language and an understanding of fundamental mathematical processes as essential to a successful college experience.</p>
<p>It also assumes graduation from an approved secondary school or home-school program.</p>
<p>Students also must submit the SAT I of the College Board or the test results of the American College Testing (ACT) program. Strong applicants who believe that standardized tests do not represent their academic achievement can choose to apply testing-optional.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence of personal qualities. <br/></strong>There is high interest in individuals of character who will contribute in positive ways to the College community. In estimating such qualities, the admissions staff relies on what students say about themselves in essays and interviews, and the confidential statements from secondary school principals, headmasters, teachers, and guidance counselors; Essentially, any evidence of in-depth involvement in secondary school activities and/or participation in community affairs is favorably considered in the admission process.</p>
<p>All acceptances by Gettysburg College are conditional and dependent upon students continuing to do satisfactory work in all subjects, avoiding disciplinary circumstances, and earning a secondary school diploma</p></div> <p> </p>

            <div class="gb-c-longform column gb-u-spacing-double gb-u-spacing-quad-top gb-l-grid--centered-large gb-u-padding-column-right">
<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>Gettysburg welcomes applications from students interested in transferring to the College. Transfer students applying for the spring semester should submit their application by November 1, and students applying for the fall semester should apply by April 15; transfers applying after those preferred deadline dates should do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Reactivating the application</strong><br/>Students who have previously applied to Gettysburg College and now wish to reactivate their application must submit a Gettysburg College Application Reactivation form. In order to update and complete the application, send the final secondary school transcript, college transcript(s), the College Report, and the Instructor Evaluation form.</p>
<p><strong>Applying for the first time<br/></strong>Transfer students should submit an application for admission, the final secondary school transcript, SAT and/or ACT results, college transcript(s), the College Report, and the Instructor Evaluation form. Transfer students who do not wish to have SAT or ACT results considered for admission can choose to apply under the College's Test Optional Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer of credits<br/></strong>Transfer credits are granted provisionally for individual courses passed with a C or better at approved institutions, provided that these courses fit reasonably well into the Gettysburg curriculum. During the first semester, transfer students must review the graduation requirements with their academic advisor or the Registrar. Transfers are required to earn all additional credit at Gettysburg College or through a regular College-approved program of off-campus study. In order to complete the transfer of course credits, transfer students are required to complete one year of satisfactory work at Gettysburg College. All transfer students must satisfy the course requirements in their major area of interest.</p>

<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>First-year students are required to participate in the USA Meal Plan. Transfer students transferring in as a sophomore or higher class year may choose from any plan, initiated members of fraternities living in College owned housing and upper-class students residing in non-apartment style housing are required to enroll in a plan listed as an option for their particular residence hall. Students residing in housing that has no meal plan requirement may choose any meal plan. Please see the Gettysburg College <a href="/offices/dining-services/">Dining Services web site</a> for current meal plan residency requirements. Students who have special dietary needs associated with a medical condition are urged to contact Dining Services for assistance. Dining Services staff members are very familiar with special diets and can provide foods necessary to meet these requirements.<h3> Dining Accommodations</h3> Dining Services offers a variety of dining options for every student. Upperclass students may select Servo Plus, which provides 20 meals per week and includes 125 Dining Dollars per semester, plus free lite fare in the Dining Center. Up-to-date meal plan offerings can be found on the Dining Services webpage at <a href="/offices/dining-services/meal-plan-information/">https://www.gettysburg.edu/offices/dining-services/meal-plan-information/</a>. Dining Dollars and meals are not transferable or refundable and must be used in the semester in which they are purchased.</p>
<p>Cooking is not allowed in residence hall rooms. An important part of the residential experience is the philosophy of “table sharing.” Students are urged to select a meal plan that enables them to eat a majority of their meals in the Dining Center which is an all-you-care-to-eat facility.</p>
<p>ID cards and meal plans are nontransferable and use of someone else’s ID card will be considered theft. Unauthorized entrance into the Dining Center and/or removing food, plates, silverware, trays, cups, mugs, etc. from the Dining Center will be treated as theft. Our no-limits policy in the Dining Center provides students with all they care to eat while in the dining room and does not entitle you to take food from the dining hall for later consumption. Taking items from the Bullet Hole, The Dive, the Commons, and Ike’s without paying will be treated as theft.</p>

<div class="gb-c-longform"><p>A student must notify the Office of Academic Advising in writing that he or she intends to withdraw or request a leave of absence from Gettysburg College. (See withdrawal and leave of absence policy.) The date of withdrawal will be the last day of attendance in classes or of residence in college housing.</p>
<p>Financial aid recipients who leave the College during a term will have their Title IV aid recalculated according to the federal refund requirements, which state: “Up through the 60% point in each payment period or period of enrollment, a pro rata schedule is used to determine the amount of Title IV funds the student has earned at the time of withdrawal. After the 60% point in the payment period or period of enrollment, a student has earned 100% of the Title IV funds he or she was scheduled to receive during the period.”</p>

<p>Students receiving financial assistance may have a portion of their original award returned to the programs as required by federal regulation and the Gettysburg College refund policy, thus creating a balance due to the College. For this reason, students contemplating withdrawing during a term of enrollment are strongly encouraged to meet with the Financial Services and Financial Aid Office prior to leaving the College.</p>

<li>25 percent, if notice is received by the sixth week of classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>No refund will be calculated after the end of the sixth week of classes.</p>
<p>*Refunds for Global Study Tuition and Program fees will be based on the affiliated global study program institution’s refund policy. Gettysburg College retains the right to charge the student for any non-recoverable costs due to the students withdrawal from the program.</p>
<p>Refunds for Room charges will be calculated based on the time the student was in their room for the semester.  A credit for the unused time will be applied to the Student Account.</p>
<p>Refunds for Meal plans will be calculated based on the time the student was on campus for the semester. A credit for the unused portion of the meal plan will be applied to the Student Account.</p>
<h2>Required Withdrawal</h2>
<p>A student who is required to withdraw for disciplinary reasons, after the stated refund period, will forfeit all fees which he or she has paid.</p>

<p>The College uses an online billing and payment system for Student Account statements and optional online payments. Student account statements are distributed monthly to the student’s official Gettysburg College email address and to anyone designated as an Authorized Payer within the online billing system. Establishing an authorized payer allows someone other than the student to receive and view, and/or make a payment to the student account. Gettysburg College encourages students to consider identifying parents or guardians as authorized payers. Students and their parents/guardians may print a billing statement from the online system if a paper copy is desired. Instructions and the link for authorized payers to access the online billing system are available online on the Student Accounts Webpage.</p>
<p>Students and their parents/guardians may make payments online from a personal checking or savings account (without a fee) or via credit/debit card (with payment of a convenience fee) using the online billing and payment system. PLEASE NOTE: Credit/debit card usage is limited to VISA, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. There will be a convenience fee of 2.75% added to each credit card payment when using this service. This fee is not associated with or passed on to Gettysburg College.</p>
<p>International students may make payment via GBURG Billing by choosing the foreign currency option and following the instructions on the screen and completing the requirements for the funds to be transferred to make the payment. Allow up to 10 days for processing.</p>
<p>International students may also make payments via the Western Union payment link on the Student Accounts webpage.</p>
<p>Payment may also be made in the form of cash, personal check, certified check, or money order. Checks should be made payable to Gettysburg College and should include the student's ID number to ensure proper credit to the student account. Checks should be mailed to Gettysburg College, Student Accounts Office, Campus Box 437, 300 North Washington Street, Gettysburg, PA 17325. Please note: A $30 charge will be assessed for all returned checks and returned online ACH payments.</p>

                <span id="" > Introduction to African-American Studies </span>
                <div id=""> Consideration of African Americans within the broader context of the African Diaspora. Students are introduced to a broad range of themes in their historical context, from the African origin of world civilization to the formation of African American societies and cultures. Other themes include the enslavement of Africans, rise and fall of slavocracy, Civil Rights and Black Power struggles, and the emergence of African-centered scholarship and praxis. </div>

                <span id="" > Introduction to African Studies </span>
                <div id=""> Introduction to the study of the history and culture of various regions and groups in Africa.  This course focuses on both the actual history and culture and how these have been portrayed from different intellectual perspectives.  Topics covered include, African philosophical beliefs; an examination of the slave trade, the participants and its impact; political traditions and systems in Africa; economic systems and the impact of, and resistance to imperialism. </div>

                <span id="" > Introduction to Caribbean Studies </span>
                <div id=""> Sunny skies, white sands, and mixed drinks with a dash of Bob Marley: that's the image many have of the Caribbean. Once the preeminent site of imperialist expansion and a major cog in the development of capitalism, the Caribbean now sits at the margins of the global economy. This multi-disciplinary course will traverse a geographically tiny, yet politically, historically, and culturally rich terrain. This course seeks to enliven the many other aspects of life in the Caribbean outside of tourism; it will commence with the historical influences of the Indigenous peoples as well as the colonizers, and cover contemporary issues such as international and sustainable development, climate change, race-based politics, and syncretic art forms and religions. </div>

                <span id="" > Race, Language, and the American Media </span>
                <div id=""> Pop culture provides us with the stories, images, and scripts that enable us to imagine and practice racial identities.  These images and practices, in turn, are imbued with gender and sexuality values and characteristics as well. The racial and ethnic norms generated by popular culture are reproduced in the ways in which audiences both perform and navigate racial terrain in their own lives. Media consumers absorb these norms in the ads they see, the movies/television they watch, and the music they listen to.  This course enables students to do critical thinking about these images, practices, and stories.  AFS 215 and CIMS 215 are cross-listed. </div>

                <span id="" > The Haitian Diaspora in Fiction </span>
                <div id=""> Study of the evolving identity of Haitians from the diaspora through careful reading of literary works from Haitian diasporic writers. The focus is on the experience of the protagonists who are exiled, and subsequently need to negotiate their past roots as independent Haitians with their new identity as displaced subjects in Europe or North America.  Major emphasis is placed on the study of literary texts, but the historical context is also covered as well as themes such as slavery, racism, post/colonialism, women, displacement, trauma, disaster and death.  A small and accessible body of postcolonial and critical theory supplements the works of fiction, and will help place the novels in their literary and cultural context. </div>

                <span id="" > Jazz: African American Classical Music </span>
                <div id=""> Jazz is appropriately considered to be African American classical music because 1) its major innovators are black; 2) it is acknowledged as a uniquely American art form, and, 3) like European and Asian classical musics, it stresses virtuosity, is performed by professionals, and (nowadays) is meant primarily for listening. This course surveys the development of jazz in relation to African American history and aesthetics, addressing socio-political contexts as well as musical style.

                <div id=""> A survey of the history of African American music in the United States, beginning with a perusal of music in Africa and the Caribbean and tracing its development from spirituals to hip-hop.

                <div id=""> Survey of  poems, essays, novels, short stories and plays written by African American women.  Starting with late 18th century poet Phillis Wheatley and ending with 1993 Nobel Prize Laureate  Toni Morrison, we investigate the political, social, and aesthetic concerns with which these women writers contend: spiritual conversion; woman's labors under slave bondage; reconstructing the womanhood and family ties in the post-Emancipation Era; protest against racist violence, specifically lynching and rape; black women's moral reform movement; racial passing and socioeconomic mobility; government challenges to black women's reproductive rights; and collaborative methods to organize black women-centered communities.

                <span id="" > African Economic History and Development </span>
                <div id=""> In this course, we explore the economic history and development of Africa, focusing on theories, methods, empirical analysis and key debates. We examine the external and internal, institutional and resource-based explanations of the region's development from pre-colonial period to the modern economy. We will consider the role of development practitioners such as international financial and trade institutions, nongovernmental bodies, and global governance institutions.
Africa is a large and diverse continent, better understood through an appreciation of individual country development experiences – many countries on the continent remain underdeveloped while others have achieved emerging status. As such, we will make use of country case studies and current events to better understand the differences and similarities of the effects of both policy responses, resource and institutional constraints.  Prerequisite: ECON 103 and 104; ECON 241 recommended.  AFS 256 and ECON 256 are cross-listed. </div>

                <div id=""> A critical examination of the literary, filmic, historical, and memorial representations of Africa. The course traces and analyzes the politics that informs the cultural constructions of Africans as people who live in particular spaces and times. The course compares various African(ist) literary, cinematic, and historical traditions and maps out the areas of convergence and differences as far as the representation of Africa is concerned. Engaging with history as a discipline, it highlights alternative ways in which intellectuals and laypeople have laid claim to the interpretation of the African past. Finally, moving away from Euro-centrism, the course emphasizes cultural productions of African writers, film directors, and public historians to show that Africans are not just subjects of history; they are equally agents of historical representation in its various guises.  AFS 262 and HIST 273 are cross-listed.  Offered as staffing permits. </div>

                <div id=""> This course explores how schooling has made us the people that we are today, and asks if formal education has prepared us for the challenges that we face in this age of globalization. The course assaults the status quo nature of education and challenges us to imagine a pedagogy that is central to social change. This interrogation of education is not meant to raze the entire historical edifice to the ground, but rather to lead us to critically reflect on the far too frequent manifestations of dull educational processes that produce conformists, rather than inspire us to creatively overturn structures of inequities. </div>

                <span id="" > Race, Gender and The Law </span>
                <div id=""> A study of how U.S. law has dealt with African Americans and Women, from their status as property to the current cases about affirmative action and 'reverse discrimination.'  Includes an introduction to Critical Race Theory and Critical Feminist Theory as approaches to viewing the law.  Each student will work with their own Supreme Court case, wrestling not only with the legal concepts contained in the case, but the historical context from which it arose, with both a broad (national) and local (parties to the case's community) focus, as well as who represented whom and how were they paid, applying theory in a direct and practical fashion.  Offered as staffing permits. </div>

                <span id="" > The Postcolonial Condition: Race, Gender & Identity in the Caribbean </span>
                <div id=""> After World War II, decolonization gained momentum across the world, and in its wake, emerged many newly-minted sovereign nation- states. Most countries in the Caribbean became independent in the 1960s, yet the Caribbean has remained a geo-political space demarcated by rupture, fragmentation and disjuncture. Myriad races/ethnicities (including indigenous, European- mostly English, Spanish, French, Dutch-, Africans, Indians, Chinese, Syrians and Lebanese) came together in the Caribbean under the rubrics of colonialism, slavery and indentureship. In this course we will spend considerable time exploring many theories of postcoloniality around the world, then connect them to various fragments of postcolonial life in the Caribbean, centering on issues of race/ethnicity, gender and identity. </div>

                <div id=""> Globalization is one of today’s buzzwords. It is at once everywhere and sometimes nowhere. It is a maddening nexus of seeming contradictions.  Although the course utilizes the Caribbean as a case study for many of the issues pertaining to globalization processes, it also pays close attention to global forces that connect seemingly divergent locales. In essence, from week to week, the course shifts from the macro to the micro and back. This affords a more comprehensive sense of the complicatedness of both the homogenizing trajectory of globalization as well as the disjunctures it engenders.

                <div id=""> Study of the evolving identity of Haitians from the diaspora through careful reading of literary works from Haitian diasporic writers. The focus is on the experience of the protagonists who are exiled, and subsequently need to negotiate their past roots as independent Haitians with their new identity as displaced subjects in Europe or North America.  Major emphasis is placed on the study of literary texts, but the historical context is also covered as well as themes such as slavery, racism, post/colonialism, women, displacement, trauma, disaster and death.  A small and accessible body of postcolonial and critical theory supplements the works of fiction, and will help place the novels in their literary and cultural context. </div>

From slavery to the death penalty, from cocaine sentencing to hate crime prosecutions, no other group has been punished more.  In the practice of law, while other groups suffer from a glass ceiling, for black men it is bulletproof Plexiglas.  This course will address the causes, conditions, and consequences of this separate and unequal treatment of black men by the law.  Offered as staffing permits. </div>

<p>Indulge your curiosity about the world and how people make their way in it as an Anthropology major or minor. You’ll learn about human cultures throughout history, explore the richness and diversity of human life in the present as well as the past, and investigate human practices, relationships, and value systems—both their commonalities and what sets them apart.</p>
<p>Your studies can focus on two of the four major branches of anthropology - cultural and archaeological - and you’ll have flexibility to set your own direction.</p>
<p>You might:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on a particular world area, such as Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe, North America, or the Middle East.</li>
<li>Attend archaeological field schools or volunteer with projects. Past students have worked in the United States, Italy, Honduras, England, Macedonia, South Africa, and more.</li>
<li>Perform anthropological research on a topic of interest. Recent students have written theses on surfing and sexuality in Costa Rica, the social role of women in ancient Celtic society, the Korean drama wave in Japan, education and development in South Africa, social hierarchy among the Susquehannock, and social divisions in a Pennsylvania courtroom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through discussion-based, lively, and interactive classes, you’ll develop strong critical thinking and communication skills. You’ll learn to think like a global citizen, gaining enhanced cultural awareness and sensitivity, as well as insight into some of the world’s most pressing social problems.</p>
<p>Our graduates have gone on to attend graduate programs in top anthropology programs; join service programs such as City Year, Teach For America, and the Peace Corps; and enter fields as varied as law, medicine, education, government, finance, and the nonprofit sector.</p> </div>

<p>Creativity, a passion for hands-on work and a drive to cross boundaries and explore cultures— an Art and Art History major or minor will give you the skills to take these interests to new levels, whether as a form of personal expression or to enrich other fields of study. In an ever-increasing visual world, our Studio and Art History programs provide crucial tools for understanding the power of images, exploring why works of art are made and why art has played such a significant role in cultures and societies throughout history. Our students love their work here and have gone on to prosper in various jobs and graduate programs, whether it be in Art Therapy, museum work or street art.</p>
<p>From curating shows to exhibiting your own work, we promote dynamic student research and creative activity by engaging the diverse and rich world of artistic expression. Working with objects first-hand is key, with numerous field trips to major museums in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. as well as an extended visit to New York City. Our majors and minors will be encouraged to expand their learning through Study Abroad for one or even two semesters.</p>
<p> Studio majors learn the technical and conceptual skills to develop and professionally exhibit their own body of work, including a digital portfolio and artist’s statement, with faculty experts and facilities in drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, printmaking and photography. You will have numerous chances to exhibit and discuss your artwork in a variety of spaces, from Introductory class work in the West Gallery to a competitive Juried Show in Schmucker Art Gallery, which includes awards. Seniors have their own private studios and work with a Graphic Designer on a professionally-produced Capstone catalog for their senior exhibition.</p>
<p>As an Art History major, you’ll develop skills in visual analysis, historical research, writing and public speaking as well as curation and exhibition display. You will learn from faculty experts in Asian Art, African American Art and Art of the African Diaspora, 19<sup>th</sup>-century America and the Italian Renaissance. Our students regularly carry out original research on works in Musselman Library’s Special Collections and have curated a vast range of exhibitions and objects, from Renaissance prints by Albrecht Dürer to polariods by Andy Warhol to an Ethiopian magic scroll in a Chamber of Wonders. Art History seniors craft their own senior thesis research topic with funding available for travel and professionally present their work as part of an Art History Symposium to the campus public. You'll be prepared for graduate study in Art History or Museum Studies or a career in a range of fields.</p> </div>

                <div id=""> Study of the history of art from the mid-nineteenth-century to today, loosely from Post-Impressionism to art made within the past five years. We critically engage with the works themselves and situate them with their larger global and cultural context and trace the evolution of artists’ various formal, social, and political commitments. In this class we will ask: What constitutes a vital artistic intervention into any era and why? What are the aesthetic, social, and technological conditions that variously inform the making and interpretation of modern and contemporary art? What publics and whose politics do art and its institutions aim to engage, contest, or occlude?  In attending to these questions, we will move more or less chronologically from the mid- nineteenth century up the present, surveying major trends and thematic, while also homing in on specific artists, exhibitions, and works that emblematize both the cultural contradiction of the modern and contemporary moment and the transformative potential of aesthetics within culture. </div>

<li>Two additional elective courses, selected from the areas listed above or in Research Methodology (Biology 260*, 460, and 461)</li>
</ul>
*Bio 206, 229, and 307 may count for the Organismal group <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span></b> the Population/Community group.<br/> **Bio 315 may count for the Cellular/Molecular <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span></b> the Population/Community group.<br/> Bio 111 (or 110) and 112 are prerequisites for all upper level Biology courses.<br/>Bio 113 can substitute for Bio 111 (or Bio 110)<br/>Bio 110 is intended as a prerequisite to Bio 112 for non-Biology majors.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li><strong>Four courses in related departments, to include:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry 107 (or 105) and 108 (or 118) - to be typically taken in the first year</li>
<li>A mathematics course, selected from: Biology 260*; Mathematics 105-106, 107, 111, 112, Psychology 205</li>
<li>One elective, selected from: Chemistry 203, 204; Chem/Phy 246; Computer Science 111 (or 107); Environmental Studies 223; Physics 103, 104 or 109; 110, 111, or 112; Psychology 236, 237, or 238; HS326.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Note: If Biology 260 is chosen to meet the mathematics course requirement, it may not also count as a biology elective course.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>A Capstone Experience - </strong>Fulfilled by Biology 307, 314, 320, 334, 335, 351, 460, or 461. All of these courses require independent research as well as a research or review paper.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements for the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Biology</h3>
<p>Students seeking the B.S. in Biology must fulfill all of the requirements listed for the B.A., plus the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>One additional elective biology course</strong> (for a total of 10 biology courses)</li>
<li><strong>One additional course in a related department</strong> (from the above list for a total of five courses in related departments - only one of the CS courses can count for the Biology major)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For those considering graduate or medical school</h3>
<p>Students applying to most medical school programs, and some other medically-related graduate schools, such as dental school, are required to complete two years of Chemistry (105 or 107, 108, 203, &amp; 204), one year of Physics (103-104 or 109-110 or 111-112), and one or two courses in Mathematics (usually 105-106, or 111 and/or 112). Most PhD programs are more flexible (see: <a href="/academic-programs/biology/current-students/graduate-school/">Graduate school for a masters or doctoral program</a>), but some do also prefer students to take both Organic Chemistry (Chem 203 &amp; 204) and Physics, in addition to the usual Biology major requirements. Students who do complete all of these courses only need 5 Biology electives (instead of 6) for the B.S., or 4 Biology electives (instead of 5) for the B. A. Students considering any graduate program should work closely with their advisor to plan their course of study.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Minor in Biology</h3>
<p>Students qualify for a minor in Biology by completing six courses in Biology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biology 111 (or 110 or 113) and 112. Both courses with at least a C- grade.</li>
<li>Four additional Biology courses that count toward the major.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students selecting upper-level courses to meet the requirements for the minor must also fulfill any prerequisites that may be required for those courses</p> <p> </p>

                <div id=""> Evolutionary biology can provide an understanding of who we are and where we came from.  Sociobiology is the study of the biological basis of social behavior. This course introduces students to the ways biologists address questions about the evolutionary origin and mechanisms of social behavior in all animals, including humans. We learn how the scientific method is applied to test hypotheses in biology and use this understanding to evaluate studies of sociobiology of animals.
Sociobiology is the part of behavioral ecology that examines the effect of the social environment on the evolution of behavior. E. O. Wilson defined the discipline and was publicly criticized by other biologists who believed that his ideas were dangerous because they could be used by eugenicists to justify social inequalities. Those dangers still exist. </div>

                <div id=""> One-semester research experience for first-year students. This course alternates between two different topics, one that is lab-based, and the other, which is a combination of lab- and field-work.  On even-numbered years students will investigate mechanisms that protect DNA and the cancer-enabling properties of cells in which critical cancer-protective proteins are missing, with a view to understanding “why normal cells get it right every time they divide, and why cancer cells get it wrong every time they divide”.  Projects use techniques of genetics, molecular biology, and genetic engineering to investigate how genome instability, marked by loss of cell cycle control and impairment of DNA repair, accelerates cancer progression.  On odd-numbered years students will investigate the startling global declines of amphibians (salamanders, frogs, and caecilians). Projects will include work on limb deformities, estrogenic compounds, ecosystem services, emerging infectious diseases, and species "arks." Students will learn techniques in experimental design, modeling, field sampling, histology, quantitative PCR, and project-specific methodologies (e.g. diet analysis, GIS, etc.). </div>

<p>Cinema, television and other media, arguably the most ubiquitous and globalized cultural forms in our world today, are often not well understood and frequently understudied. Gettysburg College offers a program and Cinema and Media Studies that will provide a broad liberal arts perspective on a powerful part of students’ lives today. This program offers both a major and minor in Cinema and Media Studies that include approaches from both Cinema Studies and paradigms for studying popular culture commonly known as Cultural Studies. Students will understand these media as not merely artistic forms, but also as cultural, economic and socio-political entities.</p> </div>

<p><b>Cinema &amp; Media Studies minor<br/></b></p>
<p>The Cinema &amp; Media Studies minor consists of six courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>CIMS 101, <i>Introduction to Cinema &amp; Media Studies;</i></li>
<li>either CIMS 250 or CMS 251, <i>History of World Cinema, 1895-1945</i> or <i>1945-present</i>;</li>
<li>Four other courses approved for the minor.*</li>
</ul>
<p>It is strongly recommended that one of these be CIMS 220, <em>Introduction to Video Production.</em> Having hands-on experience like this is invaluable even for those who do not go into the field.</p>
<p>CIMS 252,<em> Film Aesthetics and Analysis,</em> will also provide a wide range of critical skills, and will touch on film theory as well.</p>
<p>*Other than CIMS courses, electives may include: Anth 215, AS 220, Eng 303 or 413, Fren 332, 333, IDS 217, Phil 335, Soc 204, Span 353, WGS 220, one FYS film course, one Individualized Study or Internship.</p>

                <div id=""> Pop culture provides us with the stories, images, and scripts that enable us to imagine and practice racial identities.  These images and practices, in turn, are imbued with gender and sexuality values and characteristics as well. The racial and ethnic norms generated by popular culture are reproduced in the ways in which audiences both perform and navigate racial terrain in their own lives. Media consumers absorb these norms in the ads they see, the movies/television they watch, and the music they listen to.  This course enables students to do critical thinking about these images, practices, and stories.  AFS 215 and CIMS 215 are cross-listed. </div>

<p>Gettysburg College’s distinctive Civil War Era Studies (CWES) minor, housed in the <a href="/civil-war-institute/">Civil War Institute</a>, draws on the college’s unique historical location to integrate classroom experiences and experiential learning with the power of place. Minors have access to a wide range of courses, fellowship experiences, internship opportunities, and scholarly networks to enhance their understanding of the Civil War era and its continued resonance in contemporary American society.</p>
<p>At Gettysburg, the battlefield itself serves as an outdoor classroom for the study of the Civil War – but that study extends far beyond the field itself to encompass the social, cultural, artistic, economic, literary, and political dimensions of the conflict itself and the years that preceded and followed it. Students also have many opportunities to explore how the events and unresolved questions of the Civil War and Reconstruction period continue to affect American society in the 21st century and how historical memory of the era has been constructed and deployed over time.</p>

                <span id="" > Introduction to the American Civil War Era </span>
                <div id=""> Interdisciplinary introduction to the Civil War Era (roughly 1848-1877) in American history. Student is introduced to the basic history of the Civil War, with an emphasis on the fundamental causes of the war, the war years themselves, both at home and on the battlefield, and Reconstruction period. Assigned readings include a mix of primary sources and a basic survey text.  History majors may count CWES 205 as a major course. </div>

                <span id="" > Civil War Memory: Race, Politics, and Commemoration </span>
                <div id=""> An exploration of the complex, contentious and frequently contradictory ways that memories of the Civil War have reverberated in American culture from the immediate postwar years through the present day. Taking race, politics, and commemoration as primary lenses, the course will devote significant attention to the ways historical figures used the diverse landscapes of public memory – including battlefields, works of art, monuments & memorials, cultural programs, fiction and film – in an ongoing struggle to define the meaning and legacy of the war. </div>

                <span id="" > Narratives of Illness </span>
                <div id=""> This course has two objectives: firstly, to conduct an interdisciplinary investigation of the various ways that the medical profession, patients, and the state narrate illness; secondly to chart the history of medicine and public health, paying particular attention to the changing roles of doctors, the history of disease causation, and how these two phenomena overlap especially in the mid to late nineteenth century.  While this course covers a broad chronology, it focuses on the Civil War era, which gave rise to sanitary principles and provided the foundation for the bacteriological revolution at the end of the nineteenth century. </div>

                <span id="" > Introduction to War Studies </span>
                <div id=""> This course introduces students to the study of warfare from an interdisciplinary context. Students will approach the subject of war through five distinct perspectives: the philosophy of war; the history of war; the experience of war; war, culture, and society; and the memory of war. The overall goal of the class for students to develop a sophisticated approach to the study of war through an interdisciplinary way of analyzing conflicts both in the past, but also, in our present. By the end of the semester, students will endeavor to answer the following questions: what is war; how does war affect participants/victims; how do societies remember war? </div>

                <span id="" > Cameras, Canvas & Cannons: Visual Culture of the Civil War Era </span>
                <div id=""> This course examines American visual culture in the Civil War period, encompassing painting, sculpture, prints, and photography. It treats works that directly depict aspects of the conflict, and those that address how everyday life and perceptions of what it meant to be American were shaped by the war and its aftermath. We examine how the making and circulation of images shifted during this pivotal period. </div>

                <span id="" > From Reconstruction to Black Lives Matter </span>
                <div id=""> Despite the ratification of Constitutional amendments after the Civil War, which provided Black people with both citizenship and voting rights, there has been both legal and customary efforts to block Black people from gaining access to these rights.  This course examines those prohibitions but it also centers how Black people have responded; and in so doing it charts the rise of Black protest from the Reconstruction period to Black Lives Matter. </div>

                <span id="" > Gettysburg to Charlottesville: Race in the American Imagination </span>
                <div id=""> Study of the role of Civil War history and mythology in America's self-understanding and its continuing problem of race. Integrating Civil War Era Studies, Literature, Film Studies, and Political Science, the class seeks to understand the Jim Crow Era, the Civil Rights Movement, and the elections of 2008 and 2016. The class centers on the book and movie, Gone With The Wind, but will view other significant films pertaining to "race and reunion." </div>

                <span id="" > War in the Nineteenth Century </span>
                <div id=""> This is a course designed to give students and understanding of the nature of war on a global scale during the nineteenth century. Students will study the history of specific conflicts – their origins and nature – but also the ways in which war changed and transformed over the course of the ‘long’ nineteenth century. The hope for this course is that students who are interested in the American Civil War can gain further appreciation of the political and military changes associated with an age marked by conflicts of state formation and imperial expansion. </div>

                <span id="" > Aftermath: The Experience of War and ‘Modern’ Memory </span>
                <div id=""> This is a course that will examine, primarily, two conflicts in modern history and their lasting representations in cultural history and literary memory.  Wars have long cultural legacies.  Both the American Civil War and First World War changed not only the ‘war generation’ of each conflict, but also, demonstrate case studies of the representation of war and the polemics of memory within nation states.  In this class students will engage with the cultural and military histories of two different conflicts and compare their lasting impact in our contemporary perception of war and society. As such, the ‘experience of war’ will be our broad topic of consideration.  We will access this theme by examining memory sources that detail and represent these experiences over time.  The class’s methodological themes will address the following: conceptions of victory and defeat, the memory of participants and their representations of war, the writing of history and the mythologies created by conflicts and their chroniclers. By studying the cultural history of combat and its aftermath, students will learn something about the way history is written and historical events depicted over time. Through interdisciplinary representations of war in film and literature, it is hoped that students will gain an understanding of the changing perceptions of wars, within the conception of modern memory. </div>

                <span id="" > Reconstruction and the Legacy of the American Civil War </span>
                <div id=""> An exploration of the various aspects of Reconstruction, including political conflicts over how the defeated South would be treated, the struggle over civil rights for African Americans, an overview of Reconstruction historiography, the  contested nature of Civil War memory, and the enduring legacy of this vital yet often overlooked period of our past. </div>

                <div id=""> Soldier in the Confederate Army, Connecticut Yankee, friend of U. S. Grant, favorite speaker at Grand Army of the Republic Reunions. Mark Twain called himself "not an American, but THE American." No American author wrote more incisively about race, war, reconstruction, and the American Way. Mr. Clemens fought his own personal civil war against Mark Twain, and lost. </div>

                <span id="" > Field Experience in Civil War Era Studies </span>
                <div id=""> Seminar devoted to the military experience of the Civil War.  Involves detailed examination of the 19th century American military, and the major battles and battlefields of the eastern theater of the Civil War.  Students  participate in a series of day-long field trips to Harpers Ferry, Manassas, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Harpers Ferry, and Washington, D.C.  There are three formal tours of the Gettysburg battlefield and borough, and a weekend trip to the Richmond/Petersburg battle sites. Students compile a weekly journal to comment on the battle sites, and to respond to readings to an assigned list of significant battle narratives. Serves as a core course for THE GETTYSBURG SEMESTER. </div>

<p>Classical Studies provides a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to the study of ancient Greek and Roman cultures within the broader context of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations. Through the study of literature, history, archaeology, philosophy, art history, and languages (ancient Greek and Latin), our students explore antiquity through a variety of lenses that provide insight into the world we now inhabit. Through our programs, students engage in a dialogue between the past and present, reflecting on topics and questions of contemporary significance and crucial for living meaningful lives in a complex world. In addition to the courses we offer on campus, our students have opportunities to study abroad and participate in excavations with our faculty.</p>
<p>We offer a major in Classical Studies and minors in Classical Studies, Greek, and Latin. The Classical Studies major may include the study of Greek or Latin, depending on a student’s interests.</p> </div>

<h2>INQUIRE, CREATE, FACILITATE, REFLECT</h2>
<p>The Department of Education at Gettysburg College facilitates student inquiry into the nature of education from social, cultural, philosophical, historical, and psychological perspectives and encourages students to pursue collaborative, creative solutions to educational problems framed by careful reflection on the nature of education and teaching, broadly conceived. This statement reflects several core values of the department:
<ul>
<li>We believe that being located within the context of a liberal arts college positions us to provide students with opportunities to learn about education and teaching with uncommon depth and breadth;</li><li>We believe that disciplined knowledge of an academic field of study provides a foundation for exploration of the world around us and is essential to effective teaching;</li><li>We believe that the ability to conduct, interpret, analyze, and criticize educational research and claims associated with it is not only essential to effective teaching but also a key responsibility of all citizens in a democracy;</li><li>We believe that the size and structure of our program enables us to meet the individual needs of students and focus on the development of each student’s leadership potential, positioning them to enact change when they leave Gettysburg;</li><li>We believe that collaboration with partners in the Center for Public Service and the Center for Global Education, supported by engagement in the local community, enhances the learning experiences we provide by helping students see how education and cultural interaction intersect to bring about social change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teaching Education Program</h2>
<p><strong><strong></strong></strong><span>Prepare for a career in teaching immediately following graduation. You’ll study the Five Principles, take your certification exams, and complete a student teaching internship, typically in the fall of your senior year.</span></p>
<h2><strong><strong></strong></strong><span>Educational Studies Minor</span></h2>
<p><strong><strong></strong></strong><span>Add the Educational Studies Minor to any field of study. This non-certificate program will introduce you to our educational system and why it functions the way it does.

<h2>The Minor in Educational Studies</h2>
<p>The Minor in Educational Studies is designed to help students explore education as a social and cultural phenomenon by applying historical, psychological, and philosophical lenses to their investigation of its many iterations and forms. Students completing a minor in Educational Studies are well prepared to pursue teaching in graduate school or through alternative licensure programs after leaving Gettysburg, and are also well prepared to explore other opportunities in the field of education after graduation.</p>
<p>The minor is also designed to engage students in social policy issues related to education and to help students become more informed citizens by developing their understanding of the complexity of education as both a formal process and as a cultural phenomenon. The exact program of study for each minor is designed in consultation with a faculty advisor and includes six courses typically organized around a thematic core.</p>
<h3><strong>Guidelines &amp; Requirements for the Minor in Educational Studies</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>An introductory course in education: Education 199 or Education 201</li>
<li>Two courses at the advanced (300) level or higher</li>
<li>Three additional electives</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that one approved course taken off campus may be counted toward the minor, and no more than two courses may be taken at the introductory (100) level. At least four courses must be taken in the Education Department or carry an EDUC prefix.</p>
<h3><strong>The Education Project<br/></strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the required six courses that all students completing the minor must take, minors are also strongly encouraged to complete a self-designed applied project or research project in education. The Education Department is committed to working closely with the Center for Public Service to help students become immersed in the local community in an effort to make a difference in the lives of local residents, and several courses offered by the faculty of the department include field-based components that allow students to explore any of a number of different ideas and issues in a variety of educational settings. In the past students have been actively involved in local schools, have helped tutor English language learners at El Centro, have volunteered at the local YWCA, and have been involved in other programs on and off campus that have helped them make an impact on the education of kids in the Gettysburg community. These kinds of projects are strongly encouraged, as are more formal research projects, some of which may even be taken for course credit (students should discuss such options with an Education Advisor).<br/><br/>Students who wish to receive course credit for their projects may consider applying for internship or independent study credit. Students are also encouraged to present their research at Celebration or in other such venues. Students completing an Education Project will also be recognized at the department’s Capstone Presentation event.</p>
<h3><strong>Program Approval</strong></h3>
<p>Courses that are included in the minor program of study must have a substantial focus on education as a formal process or on issues related to education. Each student's program must be approved by the Education Department. To get started, students should visit the Education office in 106 Weidensall, or contact any faculty member in the department. Ultimately each prospective minor will need to obtain a signed green form declaring the minor with the Registrar and will also need to provide his or her Education Advisor with a list of the six courses to be included in your minor. This can be accomplished that by printing the form below and having an advisor in the Education Department sign it.</p>

                <span id="" > Risk Society and Education in Fukushima </span>
                <div id=""> Our society has recently been witnessing the advent of risk society, where all citizens, regardless of their geopolitical locations, are vulnerable to the unprecedented scale of risks (i.e., pandemics, nuclear disaster, environmental crisis, and terrorism). In a risk society, where two major pillars of modern society (scientific knowledge and nation-states) exhibit their limitations, citizens are compelled to reexamine their relationships with other citizens, nature, and science and technology.  Education, which had propelled modern nations’ economic development by preparing and providing a competitive workforce, must also go through fundamental changes. Using Fukushima nuclear disaster as an example, this course will guide students to examine risks that are relevant to our lives, what it means to live in a risk society, and what educational changes are necessary in the wake of such a societal shift. Multiple types of texts, including scholarly articles, films, literature, and comics, will be used in the course. Students have the option of reading the texts either in English or Japanese.  EDUC 261 and AS 261 are cross-listed. </div>

                <span id="" > Education for Social Change </span>
                <div id=""> This course explores how schooling has made us the people that we are today, and asks if formal education has prepared us for the challenges that we face in this age of globalization. The course assaults the status quo nature of education and challenges us to imagine a pedagogy that is central to social change. This interrogation of education is not meant to raze the entire historical edifice to the ground, but rather to lead us to critically reflect on the far too frequent manifestations of dull educational processes that produce conformists, rather than inspire us to creatively overturn structures of inequities. </div>

Students learn unfamiliar musical practices in their natural environment by teachers who speak Balinese, Bahasa Indonesia, and minimal English. Students reflect on their experience being a second language learner, observe how their teachers negotiate teaching non-native speakers, teach English to children in Balinese schools, and analyze competing discourses surrounding language, culture, immigration, diversity, and education found in media, public policy, curricula, and scholarly work. </div>

<h2><a name="engmajem"></a>Major in English with Education Minor</h2>
<p>The English major can be combined with a minor in secondary education, along with a teaching certification.  All English majors who are interested in receiving certification in secondary education should meet with their major advisor and the chair of the Education department no later than the fall of their sophomore year to begin planning how they will meet departmental, college, and state requirements.</p>
<p>Students pursuing education certification take a range of courses in literature, in writing, and in the history or structure of the English language. They develop both historical depth and awareness of the diverse voices that have helped shape literary tradition.  The secondary education program also requires an “education semester” of student teaching in the senior year, or as an additional semester after graduation.</p>
<p><em>More information on requirements for adding an <a href="/academic-programs/education">Education Minor</a> to the major in English.</em></p>
<p>English majors seeking teaching certification follow the standard English major except, instead of their two electives, they must take:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 200-level intermediate writing course. ENG 205 fulfills the Multiple Inquiries Arts requirement.</li>
<li>One elective, which may be ENG 111, 112, 113, CLA 103, or designated FYS in literature; a second 200-level writing course or a 300-level literature or writing course; or an academic-year internship or individualized study. </li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary education students should take a variety of English, American, and African American literature. They are also encouraged to take a Shakespeare course. THA 214, 329, or 331 may serve as a substitute for one ENG literature course.</p>

                <span id="" > Literature and Politics in Early Modern England </span>
                <div id=""> Poets, playwrights, and essayists in the early modern period were often in the thick of political intrigue, dispute, and faction. The playwright Christopher Marlowe was rumored to be a spy and an atheist and was killed in a mysterious bar fight that many attribute to his political involvement. John Milton not only is responsible for the great epic poem Paradise Lost, he was also jailed for his involvement in the English Civil War. We will study the interplay between early modern texts and their political contexts, investigating the role of drama, poetry, and prose in the power of the state and the ideological conflicts that abounded during this period. In the process we will be interested in the manner of political expression and resistance during this period, from the court-influenced writings of Thomas More and Edmund Spenser to the wonderfully equivocal public poetry of Andrew Marvell, as well as the central influence that literature and the printed text generally had on the rapidly changing politics of early modern England.

                <div id=""> Course examines representative literary works from the period in which England experiences the crisis of civil war, the turn to constitutional government, and the expansion of an overseas empire. The turn to modernity registers in a range of literary forms, from over-the-top Jacobean tragedy to Milton’s epic Paradise Lost, and from the rapidly-developing novel to the witty satires of an expanding public sphere. Class discussion focuses on strategies of close reading, with some attention to historical and cultural context.  Fulfills humanities requirement, and English Department Pre-1800 requirement. </div>

                <div id=""> The eighteenth century has been called "The Age of Reason," a designation that implies straight and narrow thinking about straight and narrow subjects.  To those of us who know and love the eighteenth century, it is hardly that.  In Fact, its literature is full of such things as horses that talk like humans, gangs of criminals that sing operatic arias in praise of their "profession," and young men who journey to London in search of adventure and get much more than they bargained for.  Through plays, poems, novels, and personal journals, we will discover just why the "Age of Reason" is a misnomer for the eighteenth century in England.  Offered occasionally.

                <span id="" > Gender and Sexuality in 18th Century British Literature </span>
                <div id=""> Eighteenth-century Britain witnessed important changes in the ways in which sexuality and gender roles were defined, from the rise of the “two sex” theory of the body to the development of an ideology of domesticity that continues to shape family and social arrangements today. Literature of the period not only explores such changes but also uses representations of gender and sexuality to mediate broader cultural changes, such as the rise of a credit economy and the shift to a limited monarchy. Rakes ruled the Restoration stage; Joseph Addison threatened to prosecute the hoop skirt for concealing women’s sexual indiscretions; and more than one novel of the period narrates a “harlot’s progress” from iniquity to respectability. This course explores how such representations  helped contemporary readers make sense of their cultural environment and shaped modern identity. Literary readings will be supplemented by short theoretical readings from the history of gender and sexuality.

Works by writers who experienced enslavement and imperial rule are juxtaposed with works in which Britain's imperial identity was written into being. Short historical and philosophical works provide context for literary works that show how imperial ideology developed and was debated and challenged over the course of the long eighteenth century. </div>

                <div id=""> Students will look at the changing shape of English literature from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century.  At a time when some theorists are asking "Is literary history possible?" we will attempt to understand a small portion of English literary history and some of the terms used to define it: "Romanticism," Victorianism," and Modernism." Among the representative authors, we may study from these three periods are Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Tennyson, Browning, Rossetti, Yeats, Eliot, and Woolf.  Through the fiction and poetry of these authors, we will also explore some of the ideas and anxieties of this age, such as the relationship between science and faith, the role of women, and the impact of colonialism.

                <div id=""> Overview of African American literature from early slave narratives to realist novels and twenty-first  century poetry. This course asks how foundational  nineteenth-century African American writers invented and adapted literary forms to redefine the United States and construct new images of blackness. Further, we explore how their work speaks to our own moment by discussing recent literature,  political discourse, and popular culture. Authors considered will include Phillis Wheatley, Frederick Douglass, Frances Harper, Charles Chesnutt, Claudia Rankine, and Ta-Nehesi Coates. </div>

                <div id=""> In 1901, Charles Chesnutt observed that the United States "was rushing forward with giant strides toward colossal wealth and world-dominion," an assertion that captures the energy, anxieties, and priorities of the later decades of the nineteenth century.  The nation’s "rushing" vigor, simultaneously exhilarating and troubling, is likewise evident in the period’s literature, which sought to document how vast cultural, technological, economic, and political changes impacted individual American lives.  In this course, we will explore these decades through the works of Rebecca Harding Davis, William Dean Howells, Mark Twain, Henry James, Sarah Orne Jewett, Charles Chesnutt, Pauline Hopkins, Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser, Edith Wharton, and Paul Dunbar, among others.

                <div id=""> American literature written between 1830 and 1860 is the focus of this course, a period that has come to be known as the “American Renaissance.”  As students explore the texts and contexts of these three decades, they will consider the implications of this name, what it assumes, and what it excludes.  The reading list will likely include Cooper, Emerson, Poe, Thoreau, Fuller, Hawthorne, Stowe, Douglass, Brown, Whitman, and Melville, among others. Fulfills humanities requirement. </div>

From novels as distinct as The Governess; or The Little Female Academy (1749) and Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (1997) and The Hate U Give (2017), the genre has long navigated the poles of education and entertainment, socializing children alternately as miniature adults, docile innocents, or imaginative rebels. After spending the semester surveying didactic primers, fairytale fantasies, beloved classics, and curious outliers from the Golden Age of children’s literature, we’ll end by asking how modern YA fiction upholds or subverts earlier ideals of childhood. Along the way, we will analyze the social, historical, and pedagogical contexts of our objects of study and ponder the surprisingly large philosophical, psychological, and aesthetic questions raised by these seemingly small texts. </div>

                <div id=""> From slave rebellions to civil war, passive resistance to armed revolt, the US experienced regular social upheaval—sometimes peaceful, more often violent—across the nineteenth century. In this course, we will explore what it means that American literature is motivated by protest. Beginning with US responses to the Haitian Revolution and ending with early twentieth-century labor unrest, we will examine the tensions between insurrection and the “domestic Tranquility” promised by the Constitution. Consulting works by authors including Tom Paine, David Walker, Leonora Sansay, Robert Montgomery Bird, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Henry David Thoreau, Harriet Beecher Stowe, John Brown, Charles Chesnutt, Ida B. Wells, and Theodore Dreiser, we will consider the myriad roles protest might play in forming “a more perfect Union.”   Fulfills humanities requirement. </div>

                <div id=""> Survey of major literary works, produced throughout the world from antiquity to the present, that have had a significant influence beyond their regional and historical origins. While on the one hand, this course aims to introduce students to the respective contexts of these distinct works, thus promoting an understanding of cultural diversity, its primary goal is to research the continuing human concerns that bring together literary traditions. In addition, the course provides students with a literary history of globalization by considering how exploration, colonization, religion, economics, and the circulation of ideas have linked disparate populations. Lastly, it asks important questions about the endurance of literature by examining broader issues such as canonization, translation, publication, dissemination, and digitization. Written assignments will focus on developing critical reading, writing, and thinking skills with a comparative approach. Although this course is taught in English and open to all students, those with reading fluencies in languages other than English will be encouraged to produce their own original translations of primary texts and to pursue research projects that allow them to work multi-lingually. In addition, declared English majors will be encouraged to investigate the wider impact of English language literature outside of Anglophone societies. Fulfills Humanities requirement </div>

                <div id=""> This course will examine major works, themes, and concerns of the African American literary tradition, focusing primarily on writings produced from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement.  Centering our discussions around the social, political, and cultural movements of the 20th century, we will consider the manner by which literature has been utilized to give voice to the reality of African Americans, thereby re-writing narratives that previously sought to exclude and negate them.  This course will engage novels, short stories, poetry, essays, autobiography, and drama as a means of not only exploring African American culture, but also ultimately considering the African American presence as central to understanding American culture as a whole.

Starting with late 18th century poet Phillis Wheatley and ending with 1993 Nobel Prize Laureate  Toni Morrison, we investigate the political, social, and aesthetic concerns with which these women writers contend: spiritual conversion; woman's labors under slave bondage; reconstructing the womanhood and family ties in the post-Emancipation Era; protest against racist violence, specifically lynching and rape; black women's moral reform movement; racial passing and socioeconomic mobility; government challenges to black women's reproductive rights; and collaborative methods to organize black women-centered communities.

                <div id=""> Now more than ever America’s role in the world is being decided in other places perhaps even more vigorously than it is in the U.S.  itself.  "Amerika" takes an international approach to the study of American literature.  This course examines the idea of America in relation to the place of the United States, considering how it may be transferred, reflected, perceived, and debated globally, as we read fiction written about the United States by foreign writers.  For some, such as Kafka, this means imagining an entirely fabricated space, whereas for others, such as Nabokov and Lorca, it means critiquing a culture found in a newly-adopted homeland.  Although we will cover early accounts, such as those by Tocqueville and Columbus, the syllabus is weighted toward the 20th century fiction from countries as wide-ranging as Germany, France, Egypt, and Palestine in order to engage current questions about the reception and creation of American culture in the twenty-first century.

This poetry is motivated by the desire to remember and to record the horror, as well as to memorialize those who were silenced.  In “After Auschwitz: A Literature of Witness,” we will read memoirs and poems written by survivors and collaborators of the Holocaust.  Additionally, we will read a memoir and many poems by the next generation of Jews, often the children of survivors.

Taking a multi-genre approach, we will also consider the manner by which fiction, poetry, film, essays, and music have presented and reflected upon the contemporary reality of African Americans.  Potential themes and events considered within the literature include: the aftermath of 9/11, responses to Hurricane Katrina, Blackness in the age of Obama, post-Blackness/post-Raciality, African diasporan identity and immigration, identity formation and social media, popular culture, intersectionality, #BlackLivesMatter, and social justice movements of the 21st Century.

We will consider the significance of orality in crafting and cultivating the forms, styles, and content of African American cultural expression.  Examining oral expressions that range from music to public speeches, this course positions the spoken word as central to understanding the complex issues of identity, culture, and politics that shape the African American presence in American society  Offered occasionally.

In this way, students assess how ethnic literature challenges more traditional forms of American culture, thereby revising traditional notions of American identity. </div>

                <div id=""> Overview of the concepts and material practices of empire (also known as imperialism) through both global Anglophone literature and pop-culture texts from around the world and across centuries. Starting with Herman Melville’s Benito Cereno (1855) and ending with the hit Fox TV show Empire (2015-2020), this course examines the multiple dimensions of empire, such as the enormous territory possessed by the British empire at its peak to the ways that the United States today is often seen as an empire for its enormous influence in global affairs. And as a transnational literature class, special attention will be paid to the global dynamics of empire as they’re portrayed by both imperial authors and writers who suffered under empire or have critiqued it. No background in empire studies needed—just enthusiasm to learn! </div>

                <div id=""> The invention of the printed book stands as a key development in human history – a technological innovation perhaps only recently matched by the Invention of digital technologies that allow for new forms of communication and human connection--just like the book. This course serves as an introduction to the vibrant field of the history of the book, which focuses on the material life of texts and the way that their materiality shapes books’ cultural impact. We will consider the book as a physical object; study the relationship between books and their cultures; and explore links between books and theories of textuality. Along the way, we will explore such issues as the evolving figure of the author, the development of copyright, and how people have experienced their reading of books over the centuries. The over-arching goal is to become attuned to the practical and theoretical consequences of books’ materiality. The work of the course will take advantage of Musselman Library’s Special Collections, and students will have the opportunity to learn about and engage in archival research. This course may appeal especially to students wishing to gain a broad foundation in issues relevant to librarianship and editing.   Fulfills Science, Technology, and Society requirement </div>

                <div id=""> This course provides students with the skills necessary to write reviews of literature for print and online publications. Students enrolled in the course will learn how to write both short and long form reviews as well as how to find and choose work to review, how to pitch reviews for publication, where to pitch their articles, how to self-edit, and how to work with editors. At the end of the course, in addition to having written a variety of reviews, all students will have written an actual pitch that they have sent to an editor. Although the focus of this course is on writing reviews of literature — whether fiction, nonfiction, poetry, plays, or hybrid genres — the skills students learn will apply to reviewing other art forms as well. Therefore, part of the course will involve writing reviews of events in the Gettysburg community such as concerts, theatrical productions, gallery shows, architecture, public lectures, et al. Furthermore, “Writing the Review” treats the review as a significant literary genre. As such, it has a heavy reading component; students will be introduced to the long history of the review and exposed to a broad range of contemporary reviewing platforms and publications, ranging from the Times Literary Supplement (TLS) to Avidly. In addition to writing reviews, they will write papers about the reviews they have read. Therefore, this course is open both to creative writing students advancing their writing skills and English students interested in the history and practice of cultural criticism.

                <div id=""> Students in this course explore ancient Denmark and Scandinavia with Beowulf—the archetypal Tough Guy—as guide, maneuvering  a mystical landscape of trolls, dragons, and witches, plying icy waters with Grettir the Strong, tasting Fafnir’s blood with Sigurd the Dragon-Slayer, swearing blood-brotherhood with Boðvar Bjarki, Bear-Warrior, and oh, so much more! Placing the Anglo-Saxon epic in the context of ancient Germanic legend, folklore, and myth, this course helps students to understand the literary geography of the poem, as well as giving them the tools to navigate this topography by introducing them to the rudiments of manuscript study and the Old English language.  Beowulf is well-known to students of English literature everywhere and even the manuscript itself is now readily available through the Electronic Beowulf project. Less familiar, though, are the sites of the epic. The location of the great hall of Heorot has long been postulated to have been somewhere in the vicinity of Roskilde in Denmark. For generations no physical evidence seemed likely to corroborate such suppositions, but recent discoveries at Lejre have reinvigorated this investigation. Archaeological work now is allowing us to place the poem in a physical geography; this opens up more fully our understanding of the world which produced the poem. In addition to a fantastic literary work, therefore, we may now begin to understand Beowulf as an artifact in a historical setting.

                <div id=""> “Love at first sight.” “Head over heels in love.”  Modern cliches abound about the onset and emotions of love. But how did people think and write about love four hundred years ago?  This course will explore the flood of love poetry, essays on marriage, and romantic comedies that began in the Renaissance with the Petrarchan poet Thomas Wyatt. What did these authors have to say about courtship, sex, marriage and the opposite sex?  What did they say to capture the interest of their audience?  We will not only be reading representations of more traditional male-female relationships in the drama and love poetry of the period, but also the homoerotic sonnets of Shakespeare, the homosocial poetry of Amelia Lanyer and Katherine Philips, and the strange figurations of divine love in the poetry of John Donne and George Herbert.

                <div id=""> In this course we will investigate the major generic forms and preoccupations of the poetry of the seventeenth-century, a period in which England stood on the verge of our modern world.  This period marked a series of radical changes and conflicts that altered the nature of society, and perhaps more importantly for our purposes, literature as well. Our focus for much of the semester will be on learning advanced techniques for reading and analyzing some of the great poetry in the English language, poetry by John Donne, George Herbert, John Milton and Andrew Marvell. We will study scansion, meter, rhyme patterns as well as a variety of poetic modes and forms. By the end of the semester, you will be expert readers of poetry, as well as better writers of it (if you are so inclined).  As we hone our poetic skills, we will connect our enhanced understanding of these poems to some of the important developments of the century, including: the political upheavals of Civil War and Restoration; the growth and spread of a Protestant and Puritan poetics and politics; the widening public sphere and rising literacy rate; the burgeoning literary marketplace and professionalization of the author; the changing role of women both in the public and domestic spheres; the profound expansion of, and centrality of London to, English culture. This is a tremendously fascinating period in British history, both historically and literarily, and there will be a lot into which to delve.

                <span id="" > Medieval Romance </span>
                <div id=""> This ain’t your mother’s Harlequin Romance, baby! Love you’ll find, all right, but not the sappy sentimental kind you might expect, and in these tales battles, dragons, and the knights of King Arthur are every bit as common as lovers’ tears, instant infatuation, and bodice-ripping passion. The genre of the Medieval Romance had its earliest vernacular genesis in French and Anglo-Norman translations of Latin epic poetry, and eventually it evolved into an extremely popular courtly narrative aimed at a secular aristocratic audience. Because of these origins and aims we might expect Romances to deal with the interests and values of the courtly class, and this is indeed often the case: Spectacles of battles, tournaments, feasts, quests, and the hunt abound, along with elaborate descriptions of clothes, arms, armor, and rituals, most notably those related to “courtesy,” or polite courtly behavior. Perhaps the most well-known conventions of the Medieval Romance to modern readers are those of courtly love and “chivalry,” the code of knightly virtue and conduct. These are indeed common facets of the genre, and often Romances in fact might be said to articulate and to validate the cultural values and practices of the elite classes of the Medieval West. The Romance is much more than a mere series of re-assertions of fundamental interests and principles, however, and often it critiques the very cultures it seems designed to laud. The Medieval Romance may be—for these reasons—more difficult to define accurately than it seems upon first inspection.  Offered occasionally. </div>

This course attempts to answer this question, studying the performance spaces, the costuming, the acting styles, the lighting of the early modern stage.

                <div id=""> Heard any good stories lately? Perhaps from the friend of a friend? All cultures have their stories, and as different as they may be on the surface, most myths and legends have some important similarities, as well as the crucial differences that reflect realities of a given culture and that make a particular story vibrant and unique. Storytelling provides answers to life’s persistent questions: All peoples everywhere ponder the same mysteries, and the answers developed by a particular culture can tell us a lot about that people. A society that worships a thunderbolt-wielding king god may be a warrior aristocracy; one that venerates an earth goddess fertility figure may be agrarian in nature; one that deifies tragic pop icons struck down by their own excesses may be obsessed with cults of celebrity and narcissism, as well as the inviolate sanctity of individual expression. A comparative approach to mythology allows us to grasp the fundamentally human nature underlying story-telling: Thus, although the stories we tell may be different from those of the ancient Sumerians, or those of the Celts, or those of the Sioux, the basic concerns addressed by those stories are often very similar indeed. </div>

                <span id="" > Eighteenth-Century British Public Sphere </span>
                <div id=""> In 1675, King Charles II tried to shut down London’s coffee-houses, declaring them dens of scandal and sedition.  In 1710, Joseph Addison declared that he would bring philosophy out of the colleges and libraries into the very same coffee-houses.  This debate over coffee-houses represents one element of a larger contest over the emergence of an eighteenth-century "public sphere," a space for supposedly free debate and investigation that also promised participants the chance to talk their way into a new understanding of both their own social status and their relationship to state authority.  This course will examine how the eighteenth-century British public sphere was thought and brought into being, paying particular attention to the ways its emergence was defined in and by literary texts.  We will also investigate broader questions about how the ways in which individuals imagine their communities and their social relationships helps to define the scope of their agency, and how the debates that structured the eighteenth-century public sphere give us ways to approach the shifts in our own public sphere brought about by the digital revolution and the rise of Web 2.0.

                <div id=""> Most accounts of novel’s “rise” in eighteenth-century Britain emphasize the genre’s “formal realism” and attribute its development to a triumvirate of male novelists—Defoe, Fielding, and Richardson. But behind and alongside that story exists a “secret history of the novel”: a story largely about fiction by women frequently more salacious, less realistic, and more formally experimental than the mainstream novel. Students will learn about this alternate tradition while practicing skills of formal analysis, historical research, and critical reading and writing. </div>

                <div id=""> “When a man is tired of London,” Samuel Johnson famously opined in 1777, “he is tired of life.” In the eighteenth century, London was bursting with life. One tenth of England’s population called it home. Many who migrated to or flourished in London found in the city a way of life that was fresh, exciting, and novel—in short, modern. In this course, we will explore how eighteenth-century cities, from London to Dublin to Philadelphia, give rise to distinctly modern forms of experience. We will examine the role that cities play in the eighteenth-century literary imagination by reading works of poetry, prose, and drama. We will focus on the nature of the individual who inhabits the modern city, and on the people who live in modernity’s shadow, at the margins of the city. Throughout, we will keep in mind Johnson’s further observation that “a great city is, to be sure, the school for studying life.” </div>

Many of the texts we will be reading were bestsellers in their day, and one of our main tasks will be to understand how these works delighted, absorbed, and scandalized eighteenth-century readers.  We will investigate the early novel's relationship with other forms of prose fiction, and we will explore the relationship between the so-called "realist novel" and some of its alternatives.

                <span id="" > The Literature of Sentiment </span>
                <div id=""> In the sentimental literature of the late eighteenth century, hearts flutter, pulses race, and ladies swoon.  The fineness of one’s feelings signifies one’s social refinement and one’s moral virtue alike. This course investigates the philosophical and social origins of this shift to sentiment and examines the poetry, novels, and plays in which sentiment circulated in late eighteenth-century Britain. Students will investigate why the late eighteenth century witnesses a shift to the body as a sign of one’s character; how the literature of sentiment represents ideals of masculinity and femininity; how sentiment is used to enforce social boundaries; and assess the reliability of moral judgments grounded in feeling.

                <div id=""> Nineteenth-century Americans were, seemingly, always on the go.  This course will explore narratives -- novels, poems, plays, and autobiographies -- that represent the possibilities and limitations associated with mobility, broadly understood.  To provide critical perspective on the train trips and sea voyages depicted in these works, we will also explore critical writings on space, place, geography, and mapping.

                <div id=""> In this course, we will explore the intersection between literature and the visual arts in mid to late Victorian England, with special attention paid to the Pre-Raphaelite, Aesthetic, and Decadent movements.  Beginning with the Great Exhibition of 1851, which celebrated all things English, we will look at the ways architects, artists, poets, craftspeople, socialists, novelists, and dandies sought to breathe life into an era which many felt had become unbearably materialistic, mechanistic, and downright ugly.  Throughout the course, we will try to understand how the search for beauty can have profound political, social, and even economic implications.  Counts towards WGS major. </div>

                <div id=""> In this course, we will take an interdisciplinary look at the literature and culture of the "transitional" period from Victorianism into Modernism, i.e., 1880-1920.  The course traces the movement in art away from representationalism towards the abstract and the surrealistic, which parallels the movement in literature away from realism towards stream-of-consciousness narrative techniques and symbolist poetry and also explore the period's interest in psychology, primitivism, and decadence.

                <div id=""> An exploration of three writers whose first and anonymously-published novels appeared between 1810 and 1820: Jane Austen, Walter Scott, and Mary Shelley.  Because they initially staked out discrete areas of their fictional works -- domestic life, English and Scottish histories, the findings of modern science -- studying these writers alongside one another should permit students to appreciate the range of concerns that preoccupied British readers of fiction during this period. Each of these novelists was situated to observe important institutions from within: Scott as a member of the bar, who was also deeply involved in publishing; Austen, with family connections to the church and the navy; and Shelley, who grew up at the intellectual center of English radical thought.  And because two of them had sharply-opposed political stances at a time of national crisis, the course should also help students recognize some of the fault lines that divided those same readers.

                <span id="" > Romantic Poetry and Poetics </span>
                <div id=""> During the romantic period in Britain, poetic culture was strongly influenced by a range of aesthetic concepts, often the focus of vigorous debate, that affected both the composition and reception of much of the writing of the period.  Among the concerns taken up by the writers of the period are attempts to define sublimity and beauty, the possibility of writing in an organic form in keeping with spontaneity of expression, the prizing of gusto, the aspiration to reconcile competing desires and aims, the effort to use figurative language as a means of exploration and revelation, the recovery of “the real language of men” for artistic purposes, the naming (through “romantic irony”) of the gap between the real and the ideal.  Readings include an extensive sampling of poems from this period, important statements about the nature of poetry by several of these writers themselves, salient reviews of their work, aesthetic retrospective statements from later in the nineteenth century about the tenor of romantic writing.  Poets on the syllabus will include Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake, Keats, Percy Shelley, Smith, Robinson, and Hemans.  Fulfills Humanities requirement. </div>

                <div id=""> This course will explore the complex relationship between British Victorians – poets, novelists, explorers, adventurers – and the larger world.  The nineteenth century witnessed the beginnings of what we now call globalization.  The British Empire stretched around the globe, and for the first time, the “common people” (rather than simply the military and merchant class) were able to travel far beyond the British Isles.  From the Brownings’ and Ruskin’s love affairs with Italy, to Darwin’s voyages to the South Pacific, to Joseph Conrad’s fictional journey into Africa, Victorians explored the world at large in unprecedented numbers.  This course will explore the accounts, in poetry and prose, both fictional and actual, of these explorations.  Authors may include John Ruskin, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, Charles Dickens, Charles Darwin, Anna Leonowens, Joseph Conrad, Rudyard Kipling, Richard Francis Burton, Mary Kingsley, and Isabella Bird.

                <div id=""> A study of the way in which Romanticism became a dominant presence in British culture during the last decade of the eighteenth century and in first years of the nineteenth.  We will concentrate on the generation of writers -- most familiarly Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge -- who established themselves during these years, and who were united by a desire to create a new poetic idiom, grounded in the claims they could make for imagination, less conventionalized and perhaps less formal than that which they saw as dominating British culture.  Crucial contexts to explore will be their differing responses to problems posed by Enlightenment thought, the French Revolution, the subsequent outbreak of war, the industrial revolution, the rise of modern science, and the dominance of English politics by Tory ministries.  Writers to be introduced, in addition to those already mentioned, may include such figures as Charlotte Turner Smith, Mary Darby Robinson, Walter Scott, and William Godwin.

                <div id=""> Between 1837 (when Victoria was crowned) and 1901 (when she passed away), approximately 60,000 novels were written and published in England.  If the eighteenth century witnessed the birth of the novel as a legitimate literary genre, and the twentieth century has seen its dissolution, then the nineteenth century must be seen as the novel's heyday.  Because most of the novels written during this period were "triple-deckers," long three-volume novels, it is impossible to study more than a few in a single semester.  But even our short list of six works shows the variety of presentation possible within the limits of the term "novel." </div>

We will read two or three novels by each writer, focusing on each novel individually, to place it in its biographical, geographical, literary and cultural context; but also stepping back to look at the three writers in relation to one another, looking for both connections and diverging outlooks among them.  We will also look at critical works and some primary documents, such as correspondence and memoirs.  Among the novels to be read will be The House of Mirth, Ethan Frome, The Age of Innocence, Sister Carrie, Jennie Gerhardt, My Ántonia, and Death Comes for the Archbishop. Offered occasionally. </div>

Writers under analysis may include H.D., Gertrude Stein, Mina Loy, Marianne Moore, Elizabeth Bishop, Adrienne Rich, Joan Didion, Mary McCarthy, Theresa Haak Kyung Cha, Susan Howe, Lyn Hejinian, Haryette Mullen, Mónica de la Torre, and Myung Mi Kim.

                <div id=""> Students begin by examining the work of key figures in the beat movement. Our focus here will be on the autobiographical imperatives behind the work of these writers; specifically, they sought to make their everyday lives the bases of their literary art. Our next concern will be with extensions of the beat impulse beyond the 1950s. In the 1960s certain comically inclined writers continued the linguistic innovations of the beats yet at the same time began to scrutinize beat efforts to construct an alternative identity. Specifically, we will look critically at the "primitivist" impulses informing the desire to become a "White Indian." We will then read works that emerged out of the more politically explosive 1960s as the hipster gave way to the hippie. Throughout this course we will be making reference to adjacent developments and innovations in the field of avant-garde or underground film practice. In addition we will investigate the decline of utopian aspirations in the 70s in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Among the writers included are Burroughs, Kerouac, Ginsberg, Snyder, Pynchon, Percy, Doctorow, Acosta, Berger, Kesey, Barth, Didion, Brautigan, and Southern. Offered occasionally. </div>

                <div id=""> At the end of A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf foresees the coming of a new generation of women writers.  It is now over 70 years since Woolf wrote her manifesto.  Since then, many women have written many books.  Perhaps now it is time to explore the new directions taken by modern women writers.  How have they used their new "habit of freedom"?  Are they writing exactly what they think?  What are they writing about? What innovations have they made on literary tradition? What shapes do their imaginative visions take? How have they revised literary history? In this course, student will read such contemporary women writers as Julie Alvarez, Margaret Atwood, A.S. Byatt, Angela Carter, Maryse Conde, Allegra Goodman, Bharati Mukherjee, Jewell Parker Rhodes, and Jeanette Winterson.

                <div id=""> This course will undertake an in-depth study of William Faulkner’s major works of fiction and their impact on -- and place within -- literary Modernism. We will begin by looking at some of Faulkner’s early influences, such as Sherwood Anderson, and then trace the arc of Faulkner’s major novels and stories, considering both their experimental and their more conventional aspects, particularly in light of the literary movements and artistic developments surrounding him and the reception of his work throughout the twentieth-century. Of particular concern will be Faulkner’s invented Yoknawpatapha County in Mississippi, his various methods of narration, and his interest in "truth," all in an effort to explore what he meant when he stated, "I don’t care much for facts, am not much interested in them, you can’t stand a fact up, you’ve got to prop it up, and when you move to one side a little and look at it from that angle, it’s not thick enough to cast a shadow in that direction." At the end of the semester, we will discuss Faulkner’s film work in Hollywood. Finally, we will begin to consider his legacy as it is expressed in more recent cultural production, particularly in literature of the Global South by writers such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Through a purposefully multi-genre exploration of African American literature, spanning from the Harlem Renaissance to the contemporary moment, we will focus on writers who identify as part of the LGBTQ community, as well as those artists who prominently feature LGBTQ subjects and figures within their work.  While examining the intersections of race, sexuality, and gender in creative expression, we will also engage the broader social, political, and cultural implications of these works, considering themes of marginalization, identity formation and articulation, social justice, and activism.

                <div id=""> Students in this course will examine U.S., Caribbean, and Latin American literature in a comparative and interdisciplinary context. Beginning in the late-nineteenth century and moving through more contemporary voices, we will read novels, poems, and critical works that address the historical and cultural relationship between the American North and South, i.e., between global geographies that
have been divided into core and peripheral zones. The concept of the 'Western hemisphere' gained cohesion through the displacement and erasure of indigenous populations across the global South.  We will therefore assess how the recovery of knowledge, history, and freedom remains central to literary works that mobilize a hemispheric imagination. Students will explore how imperialism, racialism, polyculturalism, and multilingualism not only shaped cultural production in the Americas but also provided a shared experience of loss and fragmentation that becomes the object of modernist representation across national divides. Moreover, students will examine the literary devices and narrative structures that constitute cross-regional anxieties concerning historical origins, geography, chronology, and memory across the continent. In addition to primary texts, we will engage criticism
across the fields of Atlantic, borderlands, and diaspora studies to identify and understand key concepts that span the fraught yet emerging field of transnational American literature. </div>

This interdisciplinary course investigates the origins and influences of African/ African American contributions to science fiction in the forms of literature, comic book arts, film, music, performance, and visual culture.  Beginning by highlighting the historical roots of Afrofuturism in African American speculative fiction dating back to the nineteenth century, this course then focuses on the different ways African/ African American artists and thinkers have used science fiction to critique contemporary forms of racial difference and imagine alternate futures.  Additional topics of discussion will include Afro-pessimism, Afro-optimism, utopia, futurity, blackness, and metaphysics. </div>

                <div id=""> Advanced course exploring magical realism as an international literary artform that emerges amid historic struggles for national autonomy in the global South. Students investigate magical realism as a literary expression of postcolonial thought that asserts the authority of non-Western and non-modern epistemologies. The first half of the course covers the foundations of magical realism as a Latin American philosophy and aesthetics. The second half traces the expansion and propagation of magical realism across the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. </div>

                <div id=""> While the paradigm of human rights declares a commitment to equality and universal access to basic freedoms, its development and impact in the world has been uneven and contradictory. In fact, the discourse of the human emerges precisely because a declaration of universal rights failed to emerge consistently across racial and legal lines after the French and American revolutions. Thinkers like Hannah Arendt, Giorgio Agamben, and Joseph Slaughter have shown that human rights as a field has often been marked by a structural interdependence on the state, the corporation, or, indeed, the market. This course asks how literary representations of human rights in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries raise important questions about empathy, violence, torture, citizenship, and security. By blending literature with political theory, the course explores key human rights figures such as the migrant, the detainee, the refugee, and the undocumented through novels, short stories, and graphic novels from Kashmir, Palestine, Sri Lanka, Botswana, Guantánamo and the US, and Australia’s Manus Island. </div>

Students will have the opportunity to deeply engage and critically reflect on Baldwin’s fiction, essays, and poetry.  Moreover, Baldwin’s writing will serve as the foundation for our exploration of themes of race, class, gender, and sexuality that continue to make his work as relevant in the contemporary moment as when they were first published.

                <div id=""> Students will examine literary interpretations of the American Civil War, with particular emphasis on nineteenth-century representations.  Not only a critical political and social event, the Civil War also provided a flexible reference to postbellum thinkers and writers; students will explore the different ways in which figurations of the War and the myths it spawned were manipulated to endorse or critique various political, social, economic, and racial practices.

                <span id="" > Truth and the American Way </span>
                <div id=""> This course will examine the problems and parameters of truth in the American literary traditions of realism and naturalism.  While considering the sundry implications of a fictional practice that defines itself according to standards of accuracy and truthfulness, we will also explore the ways in which such a program challenges basic assumptions about the purpose of literature, the limits of fiction, and the nature of reality.  Although the focus of the course will be on nineteenth-century American literature, we will also consider the ways in which the evolution of photography, the development of various academic disciplines (like, for example, psychology or anthropology), and changing information technologies impacted the definitions of truth, of reality, and of fiction.  The reading list will include works by Dreiser, Howells, Wharton, Norris, Chesnutt, James, and Twain. Offered occasionally. </div>

                <div id=""> This course examines the complex relationship between writers of color and America, emphasizing concepts such as patriotism, racial and ethnic marginalization, social critique, nationalism, and diasporan identity. Centering literature—to include fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and lyric—in debates over slavery, immigration, imperialism, civil rights, and citizenship across the arc of American history, this course maintains a particular emphasis on social justice movements as inspiration and context for literary production, but also as key moments for critical exploration of American identity. </div>

                <span id="" > Feminine/Feminist Aesthetics </span>
                <div id=""> Students will explore questions of difference.  Do women and men write differently? Do women and men read differently? Do men and women represent themselves and each other differently?  According to Cynthia Ozick, the answer is no: "When we write we are not women or men but blessed beings in possession of a Promethean art."  However, many people disagree with her.  According to Whitney Chadwick, "Patriarchal power is structured through men’s control over the power of seeing women." We are all involved in power struggles to name the real.  "It is crucial," writes Felicity Nussbaum, "to open texts to the power struggles that define subjectivities." Students will look at how different subjectivities are constructed and at how they are challenged and subverted.  Readings will include both theoretical texts about aesthetics as well as literary texts. Offered occasionally. </div>

                <div id=""> This course will explore the philosophical impulses, and pretensions, of American literature in the nineteenth century.  Students will read the prose of Emerson, Poe, Thoreau, Melville, Fuller, Douglass, and James in tandem with philosophical and theoretical works by Cavell, Arsic, Agamben, Deleuze, Nussbaum, and others.  It is strongly recommended that students complete a course at the 290 level before enrolling in this class. Offered occasionally. </div>

<h3>The Environmental Studies Major</h3>
<p>The Environmental Studies major is interdisciplinary with courses that draw from the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Students choose either a Bachelor’s of Arts degree (BA) or a Bachelor’s of Science degree (BS), and pursue an in-depth area of concentration. It is strongly recommended that upon declaring of the ES Major, students develop an ES major plan in consultation with an ES advisor. The plan should include a brief outline of future courses, internships, off-campus study, and independent research. While the plan may change, it encourages students to think intentionally about their academic careers and better prepare them to take full advantage of the learning opportunities available both on and off campus. Graduate schools often require particular coursework for admission, so students considering graduate school should speak with their ES advisors as early as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Core Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>Environmental studies majors, both BA and BS, take six core courses. Students typically take ES196 in their first year, and complete the 200-level core courses (211, 223, 225, and 230) by the end of the sophomore year. The 400-level capstone requirement is met in the senior year.</p>
<ul>
<li>ES 196 Environmental Science and Society</li>
<li>ES 211 Principles of Ecology</li>
<li>ES 223 Earth System Science</li>
<li>ES 225 Introduction to Environmental Humanities</li>
<li>ES 230 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems</li>
<li>ES 400 Environmental Studies Seminar <i>OR</i> ES 460 Honors Thesis</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Bachelor of Arts Requirements</h2>
<p>The Bachelor of Arts degree comprises a minimum of 11 courses. In addition to the six core courses listed above, students must take five elective courses at the 200 or 300 level outside the core. Up to two elective courses may be taken off-campus or in other departments, subject to advisor approval. All majors should complete an area of concentration through their choice of electives.</p>
<h2 id="esbs">Bachelor of Science Requirements</h2><p>The Bachelor of Science degree comprises a minimum of 14 courses. In addition to the six core courses listed above, students will take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two year-long sequences in different natural science disciplines (pick sequences from two different columns below, 4 courses in total).

<p>When you study French at Gettysburg, you learn more than a second language. You develop an understanding of other people’s worldview.</p>
<p>By removing yourself from the comfort of your habitual forms of self-expression, foreign language study—whether contemporary or ancient—teaches you to translate abstract ideas into concrete form in new ways. You come to learn that language involves not only vocabulary in the crafting of expression but also syntax and idiom, and that cultural idiosyncrasies permeate any language, including your own.</p>
<p>As a French major or minor, you’re encouraged to study abroad to build upon your understanding of French culture—and the world. We offer programs in Nantes, Paris, and Dakar.</p>

    Program Requirements 
</h4>
<div>
    <div class="gb-c-longform gb-u-spacing-triple">
<p><b>Major Requirements</b><br/>The French major, which includes a minimum of ten courses at or above the 300 level, is made up of two sequences:</p>
<p>1) A group of four required courses, three of which-300 first, then 305 and 310-should be taken before further progress in the major program unless there is a valid reason for exception. (305 or 310 may be taken simultaneously with 300 with permission of the department chair.) French 400 must be taken in the spring semester of the senior year.</p>
<p>2) A set of six electives chosen from the other departmental offerings at the 300 level.</p>
<p>All French majors are required to spend at least one semester studying abroad in a program approved by the department. The number of courses taken abroad for credit toward the major is limited to three.</p>
<p>Students planning on certification in secondary education must include a history/geography/civilization course, a phonetics course and a linguistic component in their program of study. These requirements can be met by completing Education 304 and by taking the equivalent courses in a program of study abroad.</p>
<p>Individualized study may be taken only once as part of the minimum requirements for the major. All majors must take at least one course within the department during their senior year. These requirements may be waived in special cases at the discretion of the department.</p>
<p><b>Minor Requirements<br/></b>Six courses are required for a minor in French. For students who begin in the 101-102 or 201-202 sequences, 202 will count toward the minor. In addition, students must take 300 and 305 or 310 and three additional courses at the 300 level. <br/><br/>Students who begin at the 300 level must take 300 and 305 or 310 and four additional courses at the 300 level. As with the major, courses taken abroad may be counted toward a minor, subject to the approval of the department chair. The number of courses taken abroad for credit toward the minor is limited to two. Courses taken S/U may not count toward the minor.<br/><br/>Students contemplating a minor in French should register with the department chairperson.<br/><br/>French 305 or French 310 are prerequisites for majors and minors for all literature courses. Students who have completed the language requirement and who wish to continue in French, but do not contemplate either a major or minor, may take 300, 305 or 310. Permission of the department chairperson is required for entry into all other courses.</p>
<p><b>Study Abroad for Majors</b><br/>Juniors and first-semester seniors who have completed French 300 or its equivalent may study for one or two semesters at the College's affiliated program in Paris and Nantes, France; or Dakar, Senegal. Both credits and grades from this program will be transferred, and Financial Aid may be applied to participation. Students live with French-speaking families.</p>
<p><b>Study Abroad for Minors</b><br/>Students pursuing a minor in French may study for a semester at the College's affiliated program in Paris, Nantes, or Dakar. Both credits and grades from these programs will be transferred, and Financial Aid may be applied to participation. Students live with French-speaking families.</p> <p> </p>

<p>When you study German at Gettysburg, you learn more than a second language. You also develop an understanding of the literature, history, culture, and politics of German-speaking Europe in the context of modern society.</p>
<p>By removing yourself from the comfort of your habitual forms of self-expression, foreign language study—whether contemporary or ancient—teaches you to translate abstract ideas into concrete form in new ways. You come to learn that language gives you access to cultural idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>As a German Studies major or minor, you’re strongly encouraged to study abroad to expand your understanding of German culture—and the world. We offer programs in Berlin, Freiburg, and Vienna.</p>
<p>You’ll also gain access to unique benefits of the German Studies Department, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our resident German teaching assistant, sponsored through the Fulbright Program, who assists you with grammar and organizes co-curricular activities such as films, Stammtisch, and Kaffeeklatsch</li>
<li>German Club</li>
<li>German House</li>
<li>Department events (picnics, dinners, immersion days, Winterfest)</li>
<li>Excursions to cultural centers in Washington DC and Baltimore</li>
<li>Musselman library’s impressive collection of literary texts, films, journals, newspapers, and critical work in German Studies</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll leave our program prepared for graduate study in law, public health, German Studies, student affairs, or the field of your choice, or for careers ranging from teaching to working for the government. We also have a strong record of sending graduates to Germany and Austria as Fulbright Teaching Assistants.</p>

                <div id=""> Explores a number of canonical works of German literature and audio-visual culture from the 18th to the 21st century. All works discussed partake in the discourse of "Schweigen" - a German term that refers not just to silence but also to the absence of communication, thus connecting romantic notions of "unspeakability", the limits of language, negotiations of trauma, and depictions of censorship. Schweigen will be a common denominator for the discussion of poetry and prose, film, and television productions. </div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globalization is a multifaceted and highly complex phenomenon whose historical dynamics have increased the speed and consequences of a culturally, politically, linguistically and economically interconnected world. An understanding of globalization demands a strong multidisciplinary approach, integrating perspectives, sources and methodologies from the humanities, social sciences, arts, and natural sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Globalization Studies major, fully embedded in a liberal arts curriculum, consists of core courses, and a flexible sequence of courses combining a regional and a thematic track. The regional track provides an informed approach to one region of the world; and the thematic track allow students to explore an issue such as economics, public health, education, international relations, environment, human rights, media, conflict, justice, etc., within a global perspective. All majors study abroad, and each collaborates closely with faculty to formulate a research project that will be completed in the GS capstone, addressing a specific and situated global-scale challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the two tracks are self-designed, students must complete an application for the major working closely with one of the faculty members of the Globalization Studies Academic Committee (GSAC). Applications for the Globalization Studies major must be submitted no later than fall of the junior year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a graduate, you'll be well prepared for graduate study or careers in any government, nonprofits, or the private sector.</span></p>

    Program Requirements

<div>
    <div class="gb-c-longform gb-u-spacing-triple">
<p>The globalization studies major is both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. Students <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/apply/">must apply</a> to the major and design their own course of study following the guidelines outlined below. Course requirements for the twelve-course major consist of five core courses, three courses in each of two tracks, and a senior capstone project. Globalization Studies majors must also <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/study-abroad/">study abroad</a> or complete some other off-campus program. The requirements are outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>Core Requirements (five courses)</strong></p>
<p>Core requirements for the major include four foundation courses and one methods course. Students are encouraged to complete the core requirements by the end of the sophomore year. The purpose of these core courses is to provide a common base of knowledge for all students as well as a basic set of skills and tools with which they can analyze global issues from the perspective of cultures, states, non-state actors, and systems. All five core courses must be taken on campus. Foundation courses, for which majors must earn a grade of C- or better, include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anth 103 Introduction to Cultural Anthropology</li>
<li>Econ 104 Principles of Macroeconomics</li>
<li>GS 225</li>
<li>Pol 103 Introduction to International Relations <i>or</i> Pol 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics</li>
</ul>
<p>No AP credits will be accepted for foundation courses.</p>
<p>Students take one course from among the discipline-based methods courses currently offered on campus. Students should take the methods course that best fits with the thematic track they choose for the globalization studies major. This course must be taken before the capstone, and majors must earn a minimum grade of C-. The methods courses students may choose from include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ANTH 323 Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology</li>
<li>ARTH 214 Methods in Art History</li>
<li>CIMS 226 Media and Cultural Theory</li>
<li>ECON 241 Introductory Economics and Business Statistics</li>
<li>ES 230 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems <i>or</i></li>
<li>ES 196 Environmental Science and Society</li>
<li>GER 240 Intro to German Studies: Methods and Theories</li>
<li>HIST 300 Historical Method</li>
<li>HS-232 Statistics for the Health Sciences</li>
<li>HS-326 Epidemiology</li>
<li>OMS 235 Statistical Methods</li>
<li>Pol 215 Political Science Research Methods</li>
<li>SOC 302 Research Methods</li>
<li>SPAN 304 Hispanic Linguistics Today</li>
<li>SPAN 305 Intro to Literary/Cultural Studies</li>
<li>WGS 340 Methods</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Tracks (six courses) </strong></p>
<p>Students take courses in each of two self-designed tracks. Up to three courses may be taken off campus, and students who study abroad two semesters may apply four off-campus courses to the major, though no single track may contain more than two off-campus courses.</p>
<p> <strong>Regional track </strong></p>
<p>The major requires three courses that focus on a single region of the student’s choosing. The purpose of these courses is to ground students in the realities of a particular geographic region's experiences with the processes of globalization. Students can choose to take courses that examine independently and comparatively the history, politics, economics, cultures, literatures, and fine arts of sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Western Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East and North Africa. Students may also define other regions for study, provided that the proposed curriculum and rationale are approved.</p>
<p>One of the three courses should focus on some historical aspect of the region in question and one course on some aspect of society and culture in the region. The courses that make up the regional track must draw from at least two disciplines. As part of the process of declaring the globalization studies major, students are asked to provide a rationale for their choice of regional track. The courses for the regional track must be taken at the 200 level and above, with at least one course at the 300 level or higher. Finally, students should complete the College's foreign language requirement in a language appropriate to the region on which they have chosen to focus plus one additional year of language. See language requirements below.</p>
<p> <strong>Thematic track </strong></p>
<p>The major requires three courses with a thematic focus. The purpose of these courses is for students to gain in-depth knowledge of some substantive area of globalization studies that combines different disciplines. The courses that make up the thematic track must draw from at least two disciplines. As part of the process of declaring the globalization studies major, students are asked to provide a rationale for their choice of thematic track and must demonstrate a link between their thematic track and methods course. The courses for the thematic track must be taken at the 200 level and above, with at least one course at the 300 level or higher.</p>
<p> <strong>Capstone/Senior Seminar  </strong></p>
<p>Students take an interdisciplinary capstone seminar, GS 440, during the spring of their senior year. The seminar, offered by faculty teaching in the globalization studies program, requires students to conduct research on some challenge currently facing the global system. Majors must earn a minimum grade of C-. Students must complete the methods course and off-campus study before enrolling in the capstone.</p>
<p>GS 440: An intensive seminar experience in which students in the final semester of their GS major will have an opportunity to interact, learn, and bond as a cohort. The capstone will meet once a week for 2.5 hours, during which time students will undertake a common core of coursework related to Globalization as an interdisciplinary field of study. A major objective of the capstone is the completion of an individual capstone project or thesis which reflects a synthesis of the student's regional studies, thematic tracks, study abroad experience, and capstone-related independent research. Students are expected to present their work in a public forum.</p>
<p> <strong>Study Abroad or other off-campus study </strong></p>
<p>Globalization Studies majors are required to spend at least one semester <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/study-abroad/">studying abroad</a> or participating in some other off-campus program, such as the Washington, D.C., semester programs offered through American University and Lutheran College.  Students should select a program that complements the Regional Track of their major.</p>
<p> <strong>Language Requirements for GS Majors </strong></p>
<p>All GS majors graduating in 2014 or later must also take four foreign language courses. The first two courses are required to meet the college's language requirement. The next two courses can be in the same language or in one or two additional language(s). These can be taken on campus or off campus. Half-credit language courses, such as those offered by SIT in less-commonly taught languages, will count. Languages should be appropriate to the regional track.</p>
<p> <strong>For Those Planning to Double Major </strong></p>
<p>Students who declare a major in addition to the globalization studies major may count up to three courses from their other major toward the requirements for the globalization studies major.</p> <p> </p>

                <span id="" > Sem: Decolonization in Africa </span>
                <div id=""> The purpose of this seminar is to familiarize senior history majors with the debate about the decline of the European colonial empires in Africa.  Basically, the course will provide perspectives for the assessment of the years 1940-1960 in Africa.  The wider goal is to acquaint students with both European and African conditions which contributed to the rise of African anti-colonial sentiments and the ultimate forcing of the major colonial powers out of Africa.  The heart of the seminar is the research paper.  Students will choose one of two topics: whether or not (a) World War II served as a catalyst not a cause of the independence movements in Africa; (b) Africa's economic dependency on the former colonial powers has had the effect of limiting political independence in most African nations.  For his/her topic each student will select an African country and leader.  Offered every other year. </div>

The goal is for students to understand the cultural, political, and social forces that have acted on the law, and vice versa, as well as understanding the complex ways in which law and race have shaped one another.  After this introduction, the seminar will explore these theories in historical contexts of legal case studies, legislation, and rights discourse.  Students will conduct preliminary research in the same sets of microfilmed and local court records in order to construct models of how historians might interpret legal sources, which will help prepare them for their final paper.  Their own research paper will based on original research in primary sources, and clearly link that research with the appropriate historiographical and legal schools of thought.

The course examines an extensive range of scholarly approaches to scripture in higher criticism, including historical criticism, form criticism, redaction criticism, and genre criticism. Since the Qur'an is the only extant primary source from which to reconstruct the history of Islam at its origins, higher criticism establishes the crucial link between life and literature in the past. While the Qur'an will be the primary focus, the comparative methods developed in this seminar are equally applicable to Judeo-Christian texts.  Offered every other year. </div>

                <div id=""> Senior research seminar focusing on a single historical genre: eyewitness accounts of journeys in the Americas prior to independence. From the turn of the sixteenth century on, European explorers used this traditional literary form to record their land and sea voyages in the Americas. Their texts enthralled contemporary readers with descriptions of exotic places and people. For the historian, the accounts elucidate such subjects as environmental and indigenous history, interethnic contact, cultural practices and transformations, trade, transportation, and European imperial competition. Seminar participants will write a close textual analysis and a historiography as they develop an original interpretation of one of these classic texts.  Offered every other year. </div>

<h2 id="overview">Brief Overview</h2>
<p>The individualized major exemplifies the hallmarks of a liberal arts education at Gettysburg College. Individualized majors are integrated, interdisciplinary, self-designed majors that combine coursework and other experiences from at least two departments or fields with other experiences such as internships and off-campus study.</p>
<p>Students who complete an individualized major make connections across courses and achieve an education that is more than a transcript of self-contained courses. In addition, they are self-reflective and able to write and think in ways that express a growing self-awareness about the progress and impact of their education. The individualized major program is for students who want to chart a truly original path through the Gettysburg Curriculum by designing their own course of study.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>
<p>To create an individualized major, you must develop a concept that is focused on a problem, question, or area of investigation of special interest, and that cannot be adequately addressed within a single department or discipline, or by an existing major at the college. You must <a href="/academic-programs/interdisciplinary-studies/programs/individualized-major/forms">submit an application</a> to the Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) Committee explaining your concept and proposing the courses through which you will explore it. Faculty sponsors (from two separate departments) will work with you to help you polish your application and will advise and guide you through your course of study.</p>
<p>Your individualized major must be an integrated plan of study that incorporates coursework from a minimum of two departments or fields. In addition, an individualized major includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>twelve courses, no more than two of which may be at the 100-level;</li>
<li>three or more courses at the 300-level or above;</li>
<li>a designated Methods course;</li>
<li>a 400-level capstone (IDS 464) taken during the senior year.</li>
</ul>
<p>After consulting with a member of the IDS Committee and meeting several times with two prospective faculty advisors, students should submit their applications to the IDS Committee for review. All applications for individualized major must be<strong> approved by the end of the second year. No new applications for an individualized major will be considered from students in their junior or senior year.</strong></p>
<p>Students must have a 2.5 overall GPA to be accepted into the program. Students should be aware that an individualized major may require departmental methods or theory courses and additional advanced coursework particular to each of the fields within the program. In addition, it is often possible to build a significant internship or component of off-campus study into your major.</p>
<h2 id="once-accepted">Once you are accepted</h2>
<p>If you need to make changes in the course list after the IDS Committee has approved your individualized major, you must submit a “Course Change Request Form” to the IDS Committee. This form must be signed electronically by both faculty advisors, indicating their approval. Students may change up to three courses from their originally approved individualized major. If a student needs to change more than three courses, then they must submit a new individualized major application that explains and justifies the new course of study. <strong>Note that students may not request a course change for a course that has already been completed.</strong> Furthermore, students must pass all courses approved for their major.</p>
<p>Students must earn a minimum grade of C in their designated Methods course and they may only retake their designated Methods course one time. Failure to earn a minimum grade of C in their designated Methods course requires a withdrawal from the individualized major.</p>
<h2 id="capstone-requirements">Capstone Requirements</h2>
<p>The individualized major Capstone (IDS 464) must be worked out with a student’s faculty advisors. A <a href="/academic-programs/interdisciplinary-studies/programs/individualized-major/forms">capstone application form</a> must be submitted to and approved by the IDS Committee by the end of a student’s junior year (or by the end of the fall semester if studying abroad during the spring of their junior year). Since your proposal must be approved before you can register for IDS 464, the lack of an approved capstone proposal constitutes a lack of a graduation plan, which is reason to delay your graduation date. A capstone cannot be conducted in the same semester that it is approved.</p>
<p>A student may graduate with Honors with an individualized major. Honors designation requires a high GPA (as calculated at the end of the seventh semester), the endorsement of both faculty advisors, and a 464 Capstone project that is deemed to be outstanding by the capstone supervisor when the IDS Committee is ready to request an evaluation.</p> <p> </p>

                <div id=""> This course will examine the nature of philosophy (‘the love of wisdom’) through a particular question: what is the meaning of love? Love is arguably one of the most basic, most universal, most natural things that human beings do, and yet it is also one of the most complex and paradoxical; and many of our most basic intuitions about love are irreconcilable. We believe that love should be passionate, and yet that it should transcend bodily desires.  We believe that love is the fusion of two incomplete selves, and yet, we also believe that love should be grounded
in one’s own emotional and moral strength. We believe in ‘soul mates,’ while also holding that ‘there are a lot of fish in the sea.’ We believe that love makes us stronger, and that ‘love hurts.’ We see it as both a basic biological impulse, and as a reflection of the divine in humanity. In this course we shall examine the nature of this complex phenomenon through the lenses of religious thought, film, and philosophy. </div>

                <div id=""> Once considered dormant in the United States, political movements and individual actors espousing antisemitism have made headlines here in the past two years, most notably after the October 27, 2018 shooting attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, which claimed the lives of eleven people. The perpetrator had made Jewhating statements on social media before the attack. (Many of us in Jewish Studies no longer use the word antisemitism, but Jew-hatred. The word ‘anti-Semitism’ was coined by a Jew hating man named Wilhelm Mahr in 29th century Germany. We thus now identify antisemitism for what it is, hatred of Jews.) Globally, some commentators have observed a resurgence of Jew-hatred over the past two decades. Attempts by policy-makers and activists to identify and combat Jew-hatred, whether on the streets of urban centers, across social media spaces, or in college dormitories, are often hobbled by a lack of knowledge about the history of the phenomenon. Academic scholarship, on the other hand, sometimes suffers from a lack of attention to its contemporary manifestations. </div>

                <div id=""> Literature, Language, and Life explores the unique ways in which literature enables human beings to make meaning – philosophical, religious, cultural, etc. – out of their lives. It does so through three distinct pedagogical avenues: (1) works of philosophy and literary criticism dedicated to the question of the meaning of literature itself; (2) readings of key novels from the last three centuries; (3) writings in the areas of philosophy, religion, and psychoanalysis, that are either contextually important background texts for the works in question, or works of analysis on said fiction works.  In addition, the course will address some of the major characteristics of the dominant artistic and cultural periods, such as Romanticism, Surrealism, Modernism, Postmodernism, and Metamodernism. </div>

                <div id=""> The famous inscription Woody Guthrie placed on his guitar in 1943 says something profound about how many artists and musicians view their work: while art entertains us, it also can enlighten and liberate us as well. Unfortunately, the history of America often taught in schools focuses largely on names, dates, and other facts pieced together in an effort to tell a particular kind of story about America—one that does little to help us appreciate the struggle that runs like a swift current just beneath the surface of daily life. In this hybrid/online seminar we will revisit some of that history, focusing specifically on the way musical artists have attempted to right wrongs, educate sensibilities, and awaken the consciences of people in an effort to make America a place that lives up to its promise. </div>

Discussions focus on the challenges Arab youth face in their 21st-century, globalized environments, and on their engagement with their regimes and societies, particularly in the context of the Arab Spring. Arab youth’s artistic and political expressions are discussed as a primary aspect for the transformation in the region. This course will place engagement in new media platforms within the broader context of the Arab media landscape and its history, as well as examine the socially constructed category of “youth" within a regional and historical context. Additionally, contemporary cultural and political events in the Arab world will be frequent sources of discussion.

                <div id=""> Explores the role of Enlightenment thinking in the context of Jewish intellectual history. While the Enlightenment marked a genuine revolution that affected every corner of the Western world, its radical impact is all the greater against the backdrop of Jewish intellectual life, as the cultural and intellectual space of Judaism itself within the history of the West has always been precarious and ill-defined. As a result, the collisions and renegotiations between Enlightenment thinking and Jewish thinking provide rich and fertile soil for intellectual exploration and innovations. This course will look at some of the key writings of Jewish thinkers who grappled with the implications of Enlightenment thinking, and who left a lasting impact on Jewish and Christian thinking, and on Western thought more broadly, exploring questions concerning the relation between revelation and reason, religion and the state, humanity, nature, and God. </div>

                <div id=""> In the span of a single century, and from completely different areas of study, these
four thinkers completely revolutionized the way that human beings understand themselves and their place in the cosmos. Displacing the Enlightenment notion of the self-interested, rational agent who reflects the image of God with an innate sense of the Good, these thinkers tore back the veils of all of our most cherished idols – God, language, justice, morality, rationality, market forces, and cosmic 
order. Their works not only overturned millennia of cultural assumptions; they prophesied the horrors of the 20th century, and established the framework of critical suspicion thatinforms much of humanistic study to this day. </div>

                <div id=""> Museums are repositories of the various facets of human experience. This course will examine the history of museums, the philosophy behind the human practice of collecting objects of all types (including art, history, natural history, archaeology, and ethnography), the methods used to understand the significance of objects and collections, the techniques used to bring them to light in the exhibit environment, and the principles and practices that ensure their longevity for future visitors and scholars. </div>

                <span id="" > Power, Punishment, and Pleasure: Michel Foucault </span>
                <div id=""> Explores some of the major works of 20th century French thinker and cultural critic, Michel Foucault. Few thinkers of the 20th century had a greater or more lasting impact than Foucault. Giving a new meaning to the adage, ‘knowledge is power,’ Foucault’s work challenges accepted orthodoxies regarding the concept of ‘truth’ by examining fundamental questions of power and knowledge, demonstrating the ways in which they are intertwined, as well as how that ‘knowledge’ shapes our understanding of ourselves. Fueled by the turmoil of the 1960s, Foucault’s writing crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries, leaving an indelible mark in areas as diverse as philosophy of education, history, literary theory, sociology, aesthetics, health studies, epistemology, gender and sexuality studies, and prison reform. </div>

                <span id="" > Aftermath: The Experience of War and ‘Modern’ Memory </span>
                <div id=""> This is a course that will examine, primarily, two conflicts in modern history and their lasting representations in cultural history and literary memory.  Wars have long cultural legacies.  Both the American Civil War and First World War changed not only the ‘war generation’ of each conflict, but also, demonstrate case studies of the representation of war and the polemics of memory within nation states.  In this class students will engage with the cultural and military histories of two different conflicts and compare their lasting impact in our contemporary perception of war and society. As such, the ‘experience of war’ will be our broad topic of consideration.  We will access this theme by examining memory sources that detail and represent these experiences over time.  The class’s methodological themes will address the following: conceptions of victory and defeat, the memory of participants and their representations of war, the writing of history and the mythologies created by conflicts and their chroniclers. By studying the cultural history of combat and its aftermath, students will learn something about the way history is written and historical events depicted over time. Through interdisciplinary representations of war in film and literature, it is hoped that students will gain an understanding of the changing perceptions of wars, within the conception of modern memory. </div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you study Italian at Gettysburg, you learn more than a second language. You also develop an understanding of language systems, opening the door to a country rich in art, music, literature, history, and cinematography.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By removing yourself from the comfort of your habitual forms of self-expression, foreign language study—whether contemporary or ancient—teaches you to translate abstract ideas into concrete form in new ways. You come to learn that language involves not only vocabulary in the crafting of expression but also syntax and idiom, and that cultural idiosyncrasies permeate any language, including your own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Italian Studies major or minor, you’ll have access to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning and intermediate language learning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courses in Italian cinema and culture taught in English</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic, grammar-based oral activities that improve both passive (reading and comprehension) and active (speaking and writing) skills</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exposure to Italian film, websites, contemporary events, music, and lifestyle</span></li>

                <span id="" > The Dark Side of Italy </span>
                <div id=""> This course examines the “dark side” of Italian literature and film by delving into the literary genres of the gothic and the fantastic, and the cinematic genre of horror.  In the first part of the course, we will read novel excerpts and short stories from the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries that belong (often problematically) to such literary movements as the Scapigliatura, Verismo, and Decadentismo.  In the second part of the course, we will view early Italian horror films from the 1950s and 1960s.  This course will provoke questions related to identity, desire, the unconscious, the abject, the uncanny, fear, and pleasure. </div>

                <span id="" > Bridging the Borders: U.S. Latina and Latin American Women Writers </span>
                <div id=""> This course will explore the identity and the condition of women in Latin America and the United States.  Latina and Latin American-women writers have illustrated women’s lives and experiences through their works and criticism. Their works have created women’s’ identities primarily from a borderline perspective, and sometimes from what Gloria Anzaldúa or Mary Louise Pratt refer to as a third space.  For writers, the concept of space, gender, race, and class--as well as intersections and borderlands--play an important role when depicting Latin American women’s’ representation and Latina women in the United States and their experiences. We will use a comparative analysis utilizing texts from Latina and Latin American women writers to look feminist discourse across physical, geographic or abstract borders. The concept of space as an analytical tool will facilitate our textual analysis, and will serve to establish a common ground to discuss similarities and difference regarding women’s identity and their condition in Latin America and the United States.

                <div id=""> Students in this course will examine U.S., Caribbean, and Latin American literature in a comparative and interdisciplinary context. Beginning in the late-nineteenth century and moving through more contemporary voices, we will read novels, poems, and critical works that address the historical and cultural relationship between the American North and South, i.e., between global geographies that
have been divided into core and peripheral zones. The concept of the 'Western hemisphere' gained cohesion through the displacement and erasure of indigenous populations across the global South.  We will therefore assess how the recovery of knowledge, history, and freedom remains central to literary works that mobilize a hemispheric imagination. Students will explore how imperialism, racialism, polyculturalism, and multilingualism not only shaped cultural production in the Americas but also provided a shared experience of loss and fragmentation that becomes the object of modernist representation across national divides. Moreover, students will examine the literary devices and narrative structures that constitute cross-regional anxieties concerning historical origins, geography, chronology, and memory across the continent. In addition to primary texts, we will engage criticism
across the fields of Atlantic, borderlands, and diaspora studies to identify and understand key concepts that span the fraught yet emerging field of transnational American literature. </div>

	The Business, Organizations, and Management major offers a dynamic interpretation of business, management, and organizations by utilizing a critical management perspective to better understand their relationship with contemporary society. Although the fundamentals of business and management are still relevant, the ever-changing environment of business, globalization, and the impact on society requires a more fluid and analytical understanding. The Department of Management encourages students to use the skills and knowledge they will gain to analyze contemporary issues in a critical manner that is unfettered by traditional frameworks. Workers, communities, and social justice are given equal consideration with profit and shareholder returns.

<p>At Gettysburg College, we see philosophy as a part of the well-lived life and as a bridge to all intellectual pursuits.  Philosophy is not about memorizing the views of past thinkers; it involves learning to think critically about life’s deepest questions, developing the skills of rational argument and graceful expression, and confronting the world’s challenges in ways that lead to insight, wisdom, and engagement. Philosophy points to the world, examines questions that elude empirical research, and considers the implications of what we know about the world and the human predicament. </p>
<p>Our classes include a wide range of topics and approaches, and we connect with other disciplines in courses like Philosophy of Art, Ethics &amp; Economic Life, Social &amp; Political Philosophy, the Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Film, and the Philosophy of Science. Our work is usually interdisciplinary; this leads to team teaching with faculty from other departments and offering First-Year Seminars with philosophical themes. </p> </div>

<p><strong>THE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR </strong>consists of a minimum of ten (10) courses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 100-level PHIL course or FYS taught by a philosophy instructor (<em>taken first as prerequisite to 200- and 300-level courses.</em>)</li>
<li>Three courses from our “texts in context” series including:</li>
<ul>
<li>One course in the history of traditions commonly taught in the US: PHIL 205, 206, 207, 208), or other designated courses; and</li>
<li>One course in the history of traditions less commonly taught in the US: PHIL 240, 215, 216, or other designated courses; and</li>
<li>One additional course from either category</li>
<li>A 300-level course that satisfies the “texts in context” requirement cannot also be used to fulfill the 300-level major requirement</li>
</ul>
<li>Logic (PHIL 211) or Philosophical Methods (PHIL 212)</li>
<li>Ethics or Justice (PHIL 230 or 222)</li>
<li>At least two PHIL courses at the 300-level or above; plus</li>
<li>Senior Seminar (PHIL 400)</li>
<li>An additional elective (No more than two 100-level courses may be counted toward the major.)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: PHIL 466:  Senior Thesis is recommended but not required and is taken as an Individualized Study in either the fall or spring term.  Students work closely with the entire Philosophy faculty on a subject of their choice.) </p>
<p>Note: Students who enrolled prior to 2017 are required to take two “texts in context” courses from the first category, unless they opt to take the three-course “text in context” requirement above, and are encouraged but not required to take Ethics or Justice (PHIL 230 or 222.</p>
<p><strong>THE MINOR IN PHILOSOPHY </strong>consists of a minimum of six (6) courses, structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 100-level PHIL course or FYS taught by a philosophy instructor</li>
<li>At least one course from our “texts in contexts” listings (205, 206, 207, 208, 215, 240 or other specially designated courses).</li>
<li>Ethics: (PHIL 230 or 222)</li>
<li>At least one PHIL course at the 300-level</li>
<li>Two additional PHIL electives above the 100-level.</li>

                <span id="" > PHIL-101 </span>
                <span id="" > Introduction to Philosophy </span>
                <div id=""> Study of selected philosophical issues that deal with such themes as knowledge, happiness, justice, death, and the nature of reality. The goals are to develop an ability to read philosophical texts with understanding and, through analysis and reflection, to form arguments regarding philosophical issues. </div>

                <span id="" > PHIL-102 </span>
                <span id="" > [Title Censored]: An Introduction to Philosophy </span>
                <div id=""> In considering the answers to many of the traditional questions in philosophy, a standard approach is to consider the exemplars of the practice.  For example, when Aristotle asks how we ought to live, he considers what it would be to be a virtuously magnanimous person.  But perhaps insight could come from the other direction as well.  In this class we will consider the ethically despicable character of the asshole as explicated by Aaron James and in terms of the search for truth, we will examine the nature of bullshit as analyzed by Harry Frankfurt.  Using these accounts of how not to be and think, we will turn to traditional questions in logic, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and social/political philosophy. </div>

In an effort to understand these realities, this course considers philosophical treatments of race alongside concrete social issues to address the following questions: What are the origins of the idea of race? What is the relationship between the use of racial categories and racial oppression? What role does race play in forming human identities? </div>

                <div id=""> Exploration of the social and cultural impact of technology and the philosophical  questions that technology raises. Readings will explore issues related to the autonomy of technology, virtual worlds, technology, power and knowledge, the globalization of technology, the social technologies and emergent lifeworlds, and ethics and technology.

                <span id="" > Nothingness </span>
                <div id=""> Asian philosophies started from examining absence, nothingness, and emptiness, rather than presence, being, and existence. Hinduist, Mahayana, Daoist, Zen, and Kyoto School philosophers employed ideas of nothingness to depict metaphysical principles, create ethical and self-cultivational ideals, and develop philosophies of knowledge, language, and action. Different versions of nothingness will become fundamental to explain continuity and change; argue for space-time causality; reflect on life, death, and rebirth; explore the self and its relation to the world; and understand how we think, how we use language, and how we can think, speak, and act differently. All philosophies of nothingness have a transformative power: they aim at transforming how we live by acquiring subtler insights on what is (not).

                <div id=""> Examination of the development and cultural context of American Jewish humor through the 20th century.  Jews played a significant role in the development of American comedy on stage, on radio, on the big screen, and on television.  This contribution comes from a cultural context in which Jews were both assimilating into the mainstream culture and aware of their alienation from it.  The use of humor is a double-edged sword, both bringing joy and laughter, but also allowing an oppressed minority group to make sharp points about injustices in the culture in which they live -- sometimes uncomfortably. </div>

                <div id=""> An examination of the development of analytic philosophy.  Starting with the crisis in mathematics at the end of the 19th century, leading to the development of formal logic and a re-evaluation of epistemology as a result of Einstein's theory of relativity, analytic philosophy developed new tools to solve and dissolve long-standing philosophical problems. </div>

                <div id=""> Study of the philosophical foundations and ramifications of the historical development of geometry.  Euclid's axiomatic system was held up by philosophers for centuries as the template for all thought.  But the development of non-Euclidean geometry gave rise to crucial questions about the foundations of mathematics and about the nature of knowledge more broadly.  Is geometry, or mathematics more broadly, a science?  Why are its results exact where other sciences are not?  If it is not a science, why is it indispensable for science? </div>

                <div id=""> A seminar on issues at the intersection of philosophy, psychology, and economics: the explanation and evaluation of human actions and choices.  Are we-as many thinkers have claimed-rational, self-interested, autonomous decision-makers?  How do such factors as altruism, risk and uncertainty, discounting the future, fairness, luck, and loyalties affect our choices?  How do pleasure, happiness, and well-being, and life itself serve as economic and ethical values? How can we be both moral agents and consumers, making rational, ethical choices in an uncertain world? </div>

                <div id=""> Study of the social dimension of knowledge, collective intelligence and group decision-making and agency. Traditional epistemology has focused largely on individual knowers abstracted from social contexts. Social Epistemology focuses on knowledge as a collective enterprise and on the social creation and dissemination of knowledge. Issues of epistemic dependence and epistemic authority, testimony, peer disagreement, community standards of justification and critique, the nature and function of expertise and issues of social and moral responsibility are examined. </div>

                <div id=""> Examination of the construction of notions of evil.  Using classical and contemporary texts from Western philosophy, religious thought, and literature, the course thematically engages five shapes of evil: 1) Evil and the Tragic (guilt and innocence in Greek thought); 2) Evil as Sin (the wicked will and God's role vis-a-vis evil);  3) Evil and Power; 4) The Mystique of Evil (the attraction of evil as embodied in the demonic "hero"); 5) Genocide and the Rhetoric of Evil. </div>

                <div id=""> A philosophical exploration of the nature and role of emotion in human life.  Course examines emotionality as a human capacity, emotional response as an experience, and specific emotion types, such as anger or fear.  Topics include the traditional opposition between reason and passion, between the cognitive and the emotive; the relation of emotion to morality; the possibility of "educating the emotions"; and philosophical issues related to particular emotions such as envy, jealousy, and embarrassment. </div>

                <div id=""> A study of the contentious and, at times, subversive role that the artist and artwork have played in diverse philosophical traditions. Drawing on readings from within and beyond Western aesthetics, as well as traditional and contemporary poetry, painting, and music, the course examines the threat that the persuasive power of art poses to the philosopher, the homecoming that is promised by our experience of an artwork’s beauty, and the methods of resistance and critique that are opened up by artistic expression in a global and postcolonial world. </div>

                <div id=""> The study of film as an artifact that both illuminates philosophical problems and poses new questions for philosophers about the nature of the self and community.  The course will examine how humans experience time and organize events and information through viewing film as a model of consciousness.

                <div id=""> A course that addresses philosophical questions about music, such as:  What is music?  What is a (particular) musical composition?  How is music related to our cognitions and emotions?  What is the tie between music and mathematics?  What is the relation of music to moral character?   Exploring such concepts as musical understanding, representation, expression, performance, and profundity, the course draws upon readings and music that span the centuries and the globe, and research from a range of disciplines. </div>

                <div id=""> Examination of philosophical issues underlying chemistry.  Does all of chemistry reduce to physics or are there purely chemical laws of nature?  Does the use of models in chemistry mean that chemical explanations are true or merely useful heuristics?

                <div id=""> An exploration of the concept of place (versus space) and how place matters in our lives.  The course examines the meaning of particular places-home, gardens, cemeteries, battlefields (and athletic fields), prisons, sacred places, etc.-in the context of philosophical theories of place (historical and contemporary), moral geography, the representation of place, and the philosophy of architecture. These issues are studied in dialogue with the contrasting claim that the human good is independent of place. </div>

                <div id=""> A philosophical exploration of the phenomenon of color.  Our experience of color - an important aspect of our experience of the world - poses puzzling problems of metaphysics, epistemology, and aesthetics. To address these and related philosophical issues, this course draws upon multidisciplinary sources, examining: the science, natural history, and aesthetics of color; the symbolism of colors and color patterns in culture and in literature; the relation of color and emotion; and the claim of Western “chromophobia.” </div>

    <div class="gb-c-longform gb-u-spacing-triple">
<p>The department offers both a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degree for the major.  This diverse, flexible major is well suited for a variety of careers, including secondary school physics teaching, industrial research, and graduate school in such fields as engineering, computer science, law, and medicine.</p>
<p><strong>B.A. requirements</strong>: A minimum of ten physics courses is required for the major. This includes the following six core courses, Physics 111, 112, 211, 255, 310, and an advanced lab course (Physics 324, Physics 352, Chemistry 306, or an approved course from on-campus or abroad); three additional courses at the 200-level or higher, at least one of which must be from Physics 312, 319, 330, and 341; and a capstone of either Physics 420 or Physics 460. Physics 460 requires departmental approval by the beginning of the senior year (preferably by the end of the junior year).  Students starting the physics major in their sophomore may opt to take Phy109, 110 and one additional elective at the 200-level or higher instead of the Phy111-112-211 sequence.  In addition, all physics majors are required to complete mathematics courses through Mathematics 211 or its equivalent.</p>
<p>First-year students who are considering a major should enroll in Physics 111, 112, and Mathematics 111 and 112 if possible. Those planning on attending graduate school in physics should plan to take the additional courses listed under the B.S. requirement below. Those considering graduate work in astronomy, engineering, or related fields are encouraged to augment their physics major with relevant additional courses in astronomy, mathematics, computer science, and chemistry. Students are not permitted to take more than twelve courses in the department without permission of the department, unless the thirteenth course is Physics 460 (Independent Study).</p>

<p>Political science is the study of governments, public policies and political processes, systems, and political behavior (APSA).</p>
<p>The department offers courses in four of the subfields of political science: political theory (the history of political thought and normative theory); American government (institutions, political processes and political behavior); international relations(interstate behavior, international organizations international political economy, and transnational actors); and comparative politics (institutions, political processes of other states, political and economic development). The department uses both normative and empirical methodologies to examine political issues in all of the subfields, and a principal goal of the department is to teach students how to think analytically, write clearly and persuasively, and be inquisitive and imaginative as they contend with these issues.</p>
<p>The College’s location gives students an excellent historical vantage point from which to ponder contemporary political questions. As part of the liberal arts tradition, political science students acquire a variety of skills that prepare them for a wide range of <a href="/academic-programs/political-science/careers-alumni/careers.dot">careers</a> in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Political science students may experience a rich array of activities, including internships in a variety of settings; class visits from people in academia, the public and private sectors; and participation in approved study abroad programs or programs in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Finally, students are encouraged to build curricular bridges to related academic disciplines, such as environmental studies, economics, and history.</p> </div>

    Program Requirements 
</h4>
<div>
    <div class="gb-c-longform gb-u-spacing-triple">
<p>All majors specialize in two of the four subfields in political science; therefore, they should give considerable thought to which subfields they pursue as they complete the major. <a href="/academic-programs/political-science/pdfs/2019/PoliSciMajorChecklist.pdf">View the Political Science Major Check Sheet</a> (PDF).</p>
<h2>Major requirements:</h2>
<p>A minimum of 10 courses in political science. The <a href="/academic-programs/political-science/pdfs/2019/PoliticalScienceCoursesbySubfield2015-2018.pdf">courses are categorized in four general subfields</a> (PDF) of the discipline: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Political Theory. Students take three introductory courses, two 200 and two 300 level courses, an elective at the 200 or 300 level, the methods course, and the capstone.</p>
<p><strong>Introductory Courses:</strong> Majors are required to take three of the four introductory courses. The options are: Political Science 101 American Government; 102, Introduction to Political Theory; 103 Introduction to International Relations; or 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics. Courses at this level introduce students to the core set of themes that define Political Science including the manner in which they are conceptualized by the particular subfield.  The 100-level courses may be taken in any order, and should be completed by the end of the sophomore year. Occasionally, certain First Year Seminars offered by members of the department may be used to satisfy one of the introductory courses. Students should consult their First Year Seminar instructors to see if their seminar is applicable. Introductory courses are prerequisites for all advanced courses. Students who submit an AP score of 4 or 5 in American Government may receive course credit for POL 101. Course credit for advanced placement will be lost if a student takes POL 101 at Gettysburg.</p>
<p><strong>Political Science Methods:</strong> All students must take Political Science 215, Political Science Research Methods, as sophomores or first-semester juniors. Starting with the Fall Term 2012, students must earn a grade of C (2.0) or better in POL 215 to graduate with a major in political science.</p>
<p><strong>Subfield Specialization: 200 level courses: </strong>Courses at this level explore key themes and related issues in greater depth. Students learn about the research process and how to pursue their own research questions. All students must choose two subfields from the three represented in their introductory courses. All students must take at least one 200 level course in each of these subfields.</p>
<p><strong>Subfield Specialization: 300 level courses:</strong> At this level students engage in a critical and deeper examination of specific topics that exemplify the core set of themes of importance to political scientists. All students must follow up the 200 level courses with at least one 300 level course in each of their selected subfields.</p>
<p><strong>Elective:</strong> Students may fulfill the elective requirement by taking either a 200 or 300 level course in one of the three subfields taken at the introductory level.</p>
<p><strong>Capstone:</strong> The capstone course serves as the culmination of the communication conventions in the discipline. Students will be immersed in a specific area of scholarship, will read, analyze and finally produce research relevant to the topic of the course. All seniors must enroll in a senior capstone course. The course must be in one of the two subfields pursued in the major. Capstone seminars in American Politics, International Relations, and Comparative Politics will be offered every year. The capstone in Political Theory will be offered every other year. Students who are unable to take the Political Theory capstone in their senior year may enroll in it in their junior year.</p>
<p><strong>Honors:</strong> Majors will receive Honors in Political Science if they maintain a 3.67 grade point average in the major and complete the senior capstone with a 4.00 (A) grade.</p>
<p><strong>Off Campus Courses:</strong> Students are encouraged to pursue off campus programs. Political Science course credit will be given to those courses that are consistent with the department’s subfield designations. Political science courses taken off campus will satisfy 200-level requirements only, and only two political science courses taken off campus can satisfy major requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Internships: </strong>Students are encouraged to take internships for academic course credit, but they are graded S/U and do not fulfill any major requirements. Students need to work with the Center for Career Development and consult with a faculty member on the nature of the internship and its academic requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Individualized Study: </strong>Individualized study provides an excellent opportunity for students to work with a faculty member on an important political topic and produce a significant research paper. Students need to consult with a faculty member on choosing the topic and arranging the requirements of the course. Individualized Study is graded A-F, is calculated in the major grade point average, but does not fulfill any major requirements.</p>
<h2>The Minor in Political Science</h2>
<p>Students intending to minor in political science need to understand the subfield orientation of the minor as well as the minor requirements. Prof. Roy Dawes is the department advisor for the minor and students should consult with him on choosing courses to fulfill the minor requirements. At this time, students should formally declare the minor.  Prof. Dawes will sign their minor declaration form which they will then turn in to the Registrar’s office.</p>
<p>The minor in political science consists of six courses in political science. All minors specialize in two of the four subfields in political science; therefore, they should give considerable thought to which subfields they pursue as they complete the minor.</p>
<p><strong>Minor requirements:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introductory Courses:</strong> Minors are required to take two of the four introductory courses. The options are: Political Science 101 American Government; 102, Introduction to Political Theory; 103 Introduction to International Relations; or 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Courses:</strong> Minors are required to take four courses at the 200 or 300 level that are consistent with the subfields chosen at the introductory level. These courses cannot all fall in the same subfield. The usual sequence of courses is two courses in each subfield but some students take three in one and one in the other. Students may substitute POL 215 Political Research Methods for one of these courses.</p> <p> </p>

It aims to provide students with an opportunity to unveil aspects of human condition in various political contexts though experiences of fictional characters.  The course is divided into two 
major parts. We will begin with the theories of International Relations (IR). In this part we will use the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) to understand principles of IR. Tolkien’s imaginary world provides a tangible setting for abstract theoretical concepts of IR. We will zoom into the timeless story of LOTR through the film adaptations. (No prior knowledge on LOTR is required or assumed.) The second 
part will explore three IR topics: interstate and civil wars, the Cold War rivalry, and human security. Although LOTR could be stretched to understand most aspects of these three topics, we will rely on additional visual material to examine various components of each theme. </div>

                <div id=""> Turkey is a democratic, secular, and predominantly Muslim country. It has a rapidly growing economy, making it one of the twenty largest economies in the world. Moreover, due to its geographic proximity to Iraq, Iran and Israel, and energy reserves of the Caspian Sea and Central Asia, Turkey is an important international actor especially for the West. Turkey’s unique domestic political attributes and international role in between Europe and the Middle East makes it an intriguing case for political scientists.  
This course seeks to familiarize students with the main issues around which politics revolves in Turkey during the post-1980 period. Using scholarly work conducted on different dimensions of politics in Turkey, special attention will be paid to the discussion of the issues of the consolidation of democracy, civil society, secularism, the rise of Islam, nationalism, identity politics, socio-economic changes, political parties and modernity in order to be able to capture the essence of the changing nature of Turkish politics. </div>

<p>If you’re driven to serve or make meaningful changes in public arenas, a Public Policy major can give you the foundation you need. You’ll focus on quantitative and economic analysis and the study of domestic and international institutions that make policy—governments, nonprofits, and international organizations.</p>
<p>Topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem recognition and articulation</li>
<li>Policy development</li>
<li>Ethical and legal deliberation</li>
<li>Analytic methods and policy impact assessment</li>
<li>Economic concepts</li>
<li>History</li>
</ul>
<p>In advanced courses, you’ll focus on policy areas of particular interest to you, working with a faculty coordinator to define your unique course of study. Your capstone seminar will include a formal analysis of a substantial public policy problem, and you’ll gain field experience through a required internship.</p>
<p>Public Policy graduates regularly pursue graduate studies in business administration, economics, environmental studies, health policy and administration, law, political science, psychology, public administration, public policy analysis, social work, sociology, and urban affairs.</p>
<h3>Dual major</h3>
<p>Use the public policy major as a complement to another field of study. A public policy dual major can give you a rich understanding of policy with the eye of a specialist.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in:</p>
<p>Science policy, you might dual major in Public Policy and Physics</p>
<p>Health policy, you might dual major in Public Policy and Health Sciences or Biology</p>
<p>Family policy, you might dual major in Public Policy and Sociology.</p> </div>

    Program Requirements 
</h4>
<div>
    <div class="gb-c-longform gb-u-spacing-triple">
<p>The public policy major at Gettysburg College offers a flexible, rigorous, multidisciplinary curriculum that provides training for students interested in problem-solving in domestic or international public arenas. Core courses focus on the nature of public policy, including the process of problem recognition and articulation, policy development, ethical and legal deliberation and methods of policy impact assessment.</p>
<p>The public policy major is intended to accommodate students from a wide range of interests that include a public policy dimension and serves as a second major for students whose study of public policy builds on the substantive knowledge of the first major. Students interested in science policy might choose the public policy major after their declaration of physics as a first major. Students interested in health policy might choose the public policy major after a declaration of health sciences or biology as their major. Students interested in family policy might choose the public policy major in conjunction with a sociology major.</p>
<p>The major in public policy emphasizes quantitative and economic analysis, the study of political institutions that make policy, and the examination of specific policy areas chosen by the student. Courses include analytic methods, economic concepts, ethical analysis of political institutions, grounding in history, and field experience gained from a required internship. Students choose advanced courses focusing on particular policy areas according to their interests, with the guidance of a faculty coordinator. A formal analysis of a substantial public policy problem is undertaken in a capstone policy seminar.</p>
<p>The major encourages students to achieve many of the goals that shape the Gettysburg College vision of a liberal arts education. Students are expected to draw upon skills from multiple disciplines, to learn to write well, to read critically, to assess significant ethical issues that affect policy debate, and to think analytically about global and domestic problems.  </p>
<p>Public Policy graduates regularly pursue graduate studies in business administration, economics, environmental studies, health policy and administration, law, political science, psychology, public administration, public policy analysis, social work, sociology and urban affairs. </p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>All Public Policy majors are required to have another major in addition to Public Policy.</p>
<p>All public policy majors are required to take the following core courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pol Sci 101 (American Government) or Poli Sci 103 (Intro to International Relations) or Poli Sci 104 (Intro to Comparative Politics)</li>
<li>PP 221 (Introduction to Public Policy)</li>
<li>Econ 103 (Principles of Microeconomics) and Econ 104 (Principles of Macroeconomics)</li>
<li>Statistics/Methods (<a href="#stats">choose from these statistics/methods courses</a>)</li>
<li>PP 470 Internship (requires approval from public policy adviser and Chair of public policy)</li>
<li>PP 401 (Capstone seminar, Advanced Topics in Public Policy)</li>
</ul>
<p>Students must take an additional four elective courses in an area of their interest. These courses must be approved by their public policy adviser and the Chair of public policy. The four elective courses must include one course in each of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Values and public policy: courses that treat the ethical dimensions of public policy</li>
<li>Theory and public policy: courses that provide a theoretical or conceptual framework for understanding public policy issues</li>
<li>Policy and policy making: courses that focus on the institutions through which public policy is made</li>
<li>Elective: any course in the student’s area of policy interest</li>
</ul>
<p>Students generally enter the Public Policy major with interests in a particular subject area. Below we provide a sample set of courses satisfying the requirements for the Public Policy major, organized by subject areas that students have identified as areas of interest in the past. These sample curricula are intended to inspire students to construct a set of courses appropriate to their own interests, not to limit their options. Students are encouraged to identify their area of interest and select appropriate courses in consultation with their advisor. A large number of courses offered at Gettysburg College and off-campus study programs can be used to satisfy the requirements for the major.</p>
<p>Courses taken in off-campus study programs may be used to satisfy any of the above requirements with the approval of the Chair of public policy.</p>
<p>No more than two courses used to fulfill the requirements of a student’s other major may count toward the public policy major. (Exception: Economics and Mathematical Economics majors may use Econ 103, 104, and 241 to satisfy the requirements for both Economics/Mathematical Economics and Public Policy.)</p>
<h2 id="stats">Courses that fulfill the Statistics/Methods Requirement</h2>
<p>Normally students take the statistics/methods course required by their other major.</p>

    Program Requirements 
</h4>
<div>
    <div class="gb-c-longform gb-u-spacing-triple">
<p>The study of religion provides all the benefits of any other liberal arts humanities major, and the department offers a diverse curriculum.  Faculty specialize in different geographic regions, time periods, and methodologies, and we bring the breadth of our global experience into the classroom.  We can acquaint you with the cultures of the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Europe, and the Americas.  </p>
<p>In this increasingly globalized world, we work with people from many different cultures in our careers, and it is imperative that we be able to communicate with one another.  Religious studies courses implicitly train students to re-evaluate their own most deeply held values and beliefs.  They encourage critical thinking--that is, objective, informed, and balanced insight and analysis--which can facilitate open-mindedness and communication.</p>
<h3>Major Requirements</h3>
<p>Ten courses are required for the major. At least two courses must be at the 200-level; at least two courses must be at the 300-level or above. Beginning with the class of 2020, majors must take REL 260: <em>Theories of Religion</em> (ideally prior to taking the senior capstone), which trains students in the theories and methods of the academic study of religion. This counts as one of the 200-level courses. In addition to the two required 300-level or above courses, beginning with the class of 2019 majors must take REL 400: <em>Capstone Experience in Religious Studies</em> in their senior year.</p>
<p>Majors and minors are encouraged to take Religion 101 early in their careers, though it is not a requirement for the major. Students are encouraged to take courses that examine varying religious traditions and religion in varying regions and contexts.</p>
<h3>Minor Requirements</h3>
<p>Six courses are required for the minor. At least one must be at the 200 level, and at least one must be at the 300 level or above. One of the six may be taken outside the department, but may not be in the student's major. Minors are encouraged to take REL 260: <em>Theories of Religion.</em></p>
<p>Up to two courses from outside the department may be counted toward a major or minor upon permission of the department chair and on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p> </p>

Readings include materials from many different geographic regions of the world and survey sources from the earliest periods of Buddhist history to modern times. Writings are selected from Buddhist practitioners from all walks of life: monks and nuns, mountain hermits and hermitesses, social activists, pilgrims, and court ladies.

<p>There is a distinctive vibrancy to a Sunderman Conservatory education.</p>
<p>The Conservatory offers three music degrees and an extraordinary range of opportunity for all students. As part of Gettysburg College, the Conservatory resides within an energetic liberal arts community that blends academic pursuits and engaged commitment to a broad spectrum of activities, service and creative endeavors.</p>
<p>But most of all, the Conservatory prides itself on the synergy between its students and the notable faculty who span the breadth of musical excellence. Indeed, it's this invaluable sharing of ideas, creativity and knowledge that enables Conservatory students to develop their voices as musicians as they rise to their full potential as adults.</p>
<p>The Sunderman Conservatory is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM).</p>
<br/>
<p><strong><a name="bamusic"></a>Bachelor of Arts in Music</strong></p>
<p>The Bachelor of Arts in music degree is designed for students with serious preparation for and interest in the study of music within a liberal arts context. Students build strong musical foundations through performance, applied study, music theory, music history, and world music. Advanced work in the major continues with a selection of courses that serve to concentrate and contextualize students' understanding of music.</p>
<p>Some students may choose to work with a faculty mentor to focus on particular areas of interest within music (for example, composition, conducting, teaching, jazz studies, musicology, ethnomusicology) through coursework, independent study, or internships.</p>
<p>The BA in Music offers a broad array of options, including the opportunity to pursue a second major or a minor in another disciplinary field. Graduates have gone on to pursue careers in music performance, composition, conducting, teaching, musicology, and ethnomusicology and in related fields such as arts management, arts marketing, music recording, and music librarianship. Others have completed graduate or professional programs in law, medicine, chemistry, physics, math, and numerous other fields while continuing to remain involved in music as an avocation. Admission to the Bachelor of Arts in Music is by audition.</p>

<p><strong><a name="bsmusic"></a>Bachelor of Music Education<br/></strong></p>
<p>This 36-course degree prepares students for careers as music educators at all levels in public and independent schools upon graduation. The curriculum treats all aspects of music education, including general music, vocal/choral music, and instrumental music. Music education students are given a wealth of classroom experience prior to graduation and will develop the performance skills essential to good teaching through applied lessons, large and small ensemble participation, and an impressive variety of performance opportunities. Non-Western traditions and approaches to popular music are integrated throughout the music education curriculum. While the majority of graduates move immediately into a teaching career, some may also choose to pursue graduate work in music education or in music performance, composition, or arts administration. Approximately one-half of the coursework is in music, while another 15 percent is in education courses. Students earn Pennsylvania K-12 music teaching certification upon successful completion of all requirements. Admission to the Bachelor of Music Education is by audition.</p>

                <div id=""> This course will explore the identity and the condition of women in Latin America and the United States.  Latina and Latin American-women writers have illustrated women’s lives and experiences through their works and criticism. Their works have created women’s’ identities primarily from a borderline perspective, and sometimes from what Gloria Anzaldúa or Mary Louise Pratt refer to as a third space.  For writers, the concept of space, gender, race, and class--as well as intersections and borderlands--play an important role when depicting Latin American women’s’ representation and Latina women in the United States and their experiences. We will use a comparative analysis utilizing texts from Latina and Latin American women writers to look feminist discourse across physical, geographic or abstract borders. The concept of space as an analytical tool will facilitate our textual analysis, and will serve to establish a common ground to discuss similarities and difference regarding women’s identity and their condition in Latin America and the United States.

Throughout the semester, we will consider the relationship between queer studies and studies of transgender identity, race, ethnicity, disability, class, nation, and globalization. We will end with a critique of the notion of a global gay identity from the fields of queer globalization studies and queer of color studies.
