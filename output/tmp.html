	Academic Policies 
</h2>
<h3 id="academic-level">
	Academic Level 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>A student's academic level or class year is determined on the basis of the number of course units completed for the degree according to the following listing:</p>
<div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Class Year</strong></td>
<td><strong>Units</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First Year</td>
<td>6 or fewer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sophomore</td>
<td>7-14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Junior</td>
<td>15-22</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Senior</td>
<td>23 or more</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div></div></div>
<h3 id="academic-standing">
	Academic Standing 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>Students generally maintain an academic record that will enable them to complete the requirements for graduation in the normal eight semesters. To accomplish that goal, a student needs to achieve at least a 2.00 accumulative average, a 2.00 average for the semester, and a 2.00 average in the major field of study by the end of the junior year and during the senior year and to make appropriate progress in acquiring the credits and completing the various requirements for graduation. Students who do not meet these normal standards will be given a warning, placed on academic probation, placed on suspension alert, or, if not making satisfactory progress toward graduation, suspended or dismissed permanently from the College.</p>
<p>The student who falls below the following minimum standard is subject to suspension or permanent dismissal: for the first year-1.50 GPA and six course units completed; for the second year-1.80 GPA and thirteen course units completed; for the third year-1.90 GPA and twenty course units completed; for the fourth year-2.00 GPA and twenty-six course units completed; and for the fifth year-2.00 GPA and thirty-two to thirty-three course units completed. First-year students may be suspended after one semester if their GPA is 1.00 or below.</p>
<p>A student on one of the forms of academic warning listed above is permitted to remain at the College as long as the student is making satisfactory progress toward graduation by removing the academic deficiency during the following semesters. Normally, a student may not remain at the College with three consecutive semester averages below 2.00.</p>
<p>While students on warning, academic probation, or suspension alert are permitted to participate in extracurricular activities at the College, they are reminded that their first priority is the academic program and that they must therefore give careful consideration to time commitments and responsibilities associated with extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>These students are urged to consult with their faculty advisors and the deans of Academic Advising about curricular and extracurricular choices.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="accommodation-physical-learning-disabilities">
	Accommodation of Physical and Learning Disabilities 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>Gettysburg College provides equal opportunities to students with disabilities admitted through the regular admissions process. The College promotes self-disclosure and self-advocacy for students with disabilities. Students seeking accommodation should contact the Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services for additional information.</p>
<p>For students with physical disabilities, the College provides accessibility within its facilities and programs and will, within the spirit of reasonable accommodation, adapt or modify those facilities and programs to meet individual needs.</p>
<p>For students with learning disabilities, the College accommodates on a case-by-case basis. All requested accommodation, which must be consistent with the data contained in documentation that meets the College’s standards, is reviewed by the College’s own consultant. Reasonable accommodation for students with learning disabilities may result in some curricular modifications that do not substantially alter course content or involve waiving requirements essential to the academic program.</p>
<p>For students with psychiatric disabilities, the College accommodates on a case-by-case basis. All requested accommodation, which must be consistent with the data contained in documentation that meets the College's standards, is reviewed by a qualified representative of the College.</p>
<p>The deans in the Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services assist students with disabilities with their accommodation requests.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="alcohol-drug-required-leave">
	Alcohol and Drug Required Leave 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>A key component of Gettysburg College’s mission is to provide a safe environment where students are able to pursue their academic and social goals. The College may require a student to take a leave of absence if a student illustrates that they are repeatedly unable to make sound and safe decisions about alcohol and drug use, or the student engages in drinking or drug use that threatens the life, health and safety of one’s self or others. This term of Alcohol and Drug Required Leave will be invoked for significant or repeated violations of the terms of the College’s Alcohol and Drug Policy Points System.</p>
<p>The Vice President for College Life and Dean of Students or their designee will determine the terms of the Alcohol and Drug Required Leave. Generally, students will be on AOD Leave for the remainder of the current semester of the incident plus the full subsequent semester. If a student violates the terms of the Alcohol and Drug Policy Points System by reaching or exceeding ten points, the terms of the Alcohol and Drug Required Leave will normally include a provision for the student to receive care (medical, psychiatric, psychological, counseling, or therapy) while on leave.</p>
<p>Our procedures will follow the protocol outlined in the Medical Leave of Absence and Withdrawal Policy of the Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities. The Vice President for College Life and Dean of Students or their designee may identify additional criteria in order to return to campus. The Vice President for College Life and Dean of Students or their designee, in consultation with Health and Counseling Services, will determine if all criteria have been met and if the student is eligible to return. If a student is required to leave during the fall semester, normally the leave will be extended to the entire spring semester as well.</p>
<p>A student returning from Required Leave will have 5 points on their record upon return.</p>
<p>A student that accumulates 10 or more points for a SECOND time during their Gettysburg career will be referred to the Student Conduct Review Board for consideration of suspension/expulsion, along with any sanctions assigned through the point system process. Instances of any of these behaviors, whether alcohol-related or not, could also be referred to the Student Conduct Review Board for consideration of possible suspension or expulsion (along with other sanctions, as detailed in the Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities).</p></div></div>
<h3 id="center-global-education">
	Center for Global Education 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>If you are thinking about making global study a part of your education, you will be joining over 350 of your peers who study globally each year (almost 60% of the class of 2020). Gettysburg College considers global study to be a vital part of its academic program.</p>
<p>Students study globally for many different reasons. Whether you want to develop language skills, make your resume stand out from the crowd, build global competencies that are important to employers, and/or to add a special facet to your degree, you will find that global study gives you these opportunities—and many more. Students can study globally as soon as the first semester of their sophomore year, and as late as the first semester of senior year.</p>
<p>Anyone can, and everyone should, study globally. Please feel welcome to discuss any accommodation that will be necessary for you to study globally with a CGE advisor, or any questions you may have anticipating your experience off campus.</p>
<p>All students must meet the stated <a href="/offices/center-for-global-education/getting-started/policies/eligibility">eligibility requirements</a> in order to study globally. For detailed information about the Center for Global Education, please visit our <a href="/offices/center-for-global-education/">website</a>.</p></div></div>

	Class Attendance General Policies and Policies for Athletics &amp; Other Extracurricular Activities 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p><strong>From Faculty Handbook, 2005 Edition</strong></p>
<p>“At the heart of Gettysburg College,” insists the College’s Statement of Purpose “is the academic program.” Commitments to the academic program take priority over other College activities. But, the College also offers students the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities because it believes that these activities can make important contributions to their education as whole persons. The following statement describes the appropriate relationship between academic and extracurricular activities.</p>

<p>The College recognizes that regular attendance at all classes is an essential part of its academic purpose and clearly is the responsibility of the individual student. Each student is accountable for all work missed because of absences from class, and instructors are under no obligation to make special arrangements for students who are absent from classes. Instructors must explain their individual or departmental attendance policy during the first class meeting and/or in their course outlines.</p>
<p>Class absences will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis by the instructor of the course. There is no such thing as an “officially excused” absence from a class at Gettysburg College. If a student will miss class for any reason (for example, religious observances, college trips, family emergencies, or illness), students must discuss this absence with their instructor in advance whenever possible. The student will be ultimately responsible for making up any missed work; however, in some cases, it may not be possible to make up missed work. When students are seen in the Health Center, they are provided documentation of each appointment, and they can share this documentation with faculty if needed.</p>
<p>If you must miss class, we encourage you to notify your professors as soon as possible with as much information as you can provide about the date of your anticipated absence, the reasons, and your plan for making up any missed work. Students should ask the professor to let them know if they have any questions about the absence or any instructions to give about making up the missed work. Students should include in any written or e-mail message their campus box number, telephone number, and e-mail address.</p>
<p>On occasion, even if absences are due to documented medical or emergency situations, students may miss so much class that they are not able to meet the goals of the course. In these cases, students may be advised to withdraw from the course.</p>
<p>A student who receives an Excessive Absence Warning through the online Progress/Midterm Deficiency Report system is being formally notified that an instructor has warned the student about excessive absence in the course and that further absence may result in the student being required to withdraw from the course.</p>
<p>The Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services may notify faculty of certain student absences, by request, if the student is unable to notify faculty directly. Health Services does not write notes for students but will contact the Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services about student visits or certain diagnoses at a student’s request. These notifications are not to be construed as “official excuses” sanctioned by the Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services; individual faculty are far better suited to assess the legitimacy of students’ explanations for an absence than the Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services. The Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services does not notify faculty of sports or college related absences.</p>
<h2>Practice and Activities Times</h2>
<p>The period from 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Monday through Friday has traditionally been set aside for athletic practices and other extra-curricular activities. It is intended that activities such as band, choir, theatre productions, community service activities, and athletic practices will ordinarily take place during this time without conflict with scheduled classes or with other academic obligations, including make-up tests.</p>
<p>It is a violation of NCAA regulations for a coach to require an athlete to attend a practice that conflicts with a class. Therefore, no student will be expected to miss a class or leave class early in order to be at practice.</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially early in the second semester, indoor athletic practices must be scheduled. Because the College lacks sufficient space for all teams to practice indoors between 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., practices will occasionally meet at other times. No practice scheduled at a time other than 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. can be made mandatory for athletes. If such a practice conflicts with an assigned academic activity, the academic activity must take precedence. Apart from the condition just specified, no formal or informal team practices, training sessions, etc. should be scheduled at times other than 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>It is especially important that faculty let students know if testing; review sessions, extra classes, etc. will be scheduled in the 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. period. Faculty members should make every effort to avoid the situation where the only opportunity for a student to make up a test or complete some other required activity occurs between 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>An administrator from the College Life Division shall act as a liaison between students, faculty, coaches, and advisors of extra-curricular organizations should complaints or misunderstandings arise concerning the implementation of this policy. It will be the responsibility of coaches and advisors of extra-curricular activities to be sure that all students involved in athletics and these activities are aware of this person and his or her function.</p>
<h2>Absences Due to Athletic Contests or Other Extracurricular Activities</h2>
<p>As noted in the College’s Policy on Class Attendance, it is the student’s responsibility to request permission from faculty members to miss class because of a scheduled event and to make arrangements with the faculty members to make up any work missed because of an athletic contest or other extracurricular activity. If the level of anticipated absences is so high that the student may have problems in reasonably meeting the requirements of the course for class attendance and other matters, the student has the responsibility of determining whether or not it is possible for him or her to continue to participate in that extracurricular activity. If it is not possible to continue to participate in the extracurricular activity and still meet the requirements of the class, the student must decide whether to withdraw from the activity or, in certain circumstances, to postpone the class to a later semester.</p>
<p>If, for any reason, (including injury or disciplinary sanction by a coach), a student will not be playing in an away game and this is known before the team leaves for the game, a student should be so informed and not be required to travel with the team. Coaches will encourage students who will not be playing in a contest (where the trip to the contest requires them to miss a class) to attend class rather than miss the class.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="deans-list">
	Deans List 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>The names of those students who attain an average of 3.60 or higher for the semester are placed on the Deans Honor List in recognition of their academic achievements. Also, those students who attain an average from 3.30 to 3.59 are placed on the Deans Commendation List. To be eligible for these honors, students must take a full course load of at least four courses, with no more than one course taken under the S/U grading option during that semester (except for students participating in the Lutheran College Washington Semester program, who may take two units S/U). First-year students who attain an average of 3.00 to 3.29 are placed on a First-Year Recognition List for commendable academic performance in their first or second semester.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="exemption-from-degree-requirements">
	Exemption from Degree Requirements 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>The College may recognize work on the college-level completed elsewhere by a student. This recognition may take the form of exemption from degree requirements and may carry academic credit. Students should present their requests for exemption to the Registrar. They should be prepared to demonstrate their competence on the basis of their academic record, Advanced Placement Examination results of the College Board, or examinations administered by the department concerned. Decisions on exemption and credit rest with the department and the Registrar.</p>
<p>International and other students who learned in a language other than English during the final three years of secondary school may petition for exemption from the second language requirement. Please contact <a href="/offices/registrar/">Office of the Registrar</a> for additional information.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="grading-system">
	Grading System 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>Courses are normally graded A through F, with these grades having the following significance:<br/> A (excellent); B (good); C (fair); D (poor); and F (failing). Instructors may modify their letter grades with plus and minus signs.</p>
<p>In successfully completing a course under this grading system, a student earns a number of quality points according to the following scale.</p>
<div>
<div>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Letter grade</th>
<th>A+</th>
<th>A</th>
<th>A-</th>
<th>B+</th>
<th>B</th>
<th>B-</th>
<th>C+</th>

<td>1.33</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p>A student’s accumulative average is computed by summing his or her quality points and dividing by the number of course units taken. The average is rounded to the second decimal place.</p>
<p>The College reserves the right to make changes and adjustments in the grading system even after a student enrolls.</p>
<p>The College offers a satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading option. This option is intended to encourage students to be adventurous intellectually in courses with subject matter or approaches substantially different from their prior academic experience or attainment. An S signifies satisfactory work, and is given if a student performs at the C- level or higher; a U signifies unsatisfactory work, and is given for work below the C- level. Courses graded S/U do not affect a student’s quality point average, but a course completed with an S grade will count toward the total number of courses needed for graduation. A student may elect to take a total of six courses on an S/U basis during his or her four years at Gettysburg College; however, no more than two S/U courses may be taken in any one year. This grading option may not be selected for requirements for graduation, or for courses taken in a student’s major field. Exceptions may be made with regard to the major in cases where a department specifies that a particular course is available under the S/U grading system only, and in cases where the student declares the major after taking the course. A student must choose the S/U grading option during the first ten class days of the semester.</p>
<p>Students who enroll in Education 476: Student Teaching may take an additional course under the S/U option during the senior year, provided that their total number of S/U courses does not exceed six.</p>
<p>When a student registers for and completes a course which he or she has already taken at Gettysburg College, both the credit and the grade previously earned are canceled, but they are not removed from the permanent record. The credit and grade earned in repeating the course are counted toward the student’s requirements.</p>
<p>A grade of Inc (Incomplete) is issued by instructors when emergency situations, such as illness, prevent a student from completing the course requirements on time. The Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services supports instructors in their decision to give a student an INC or NG when extenuating circumstances (e.g., sickness, a recent death in the immediate family, serious personal problems, or other circumstance of equal gravity) prevents completion of course requirements by the end of the semester. The Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services <strong><em>does not</em></strong> document or maintain INC/NG agreements made between students and instructors.</p>
<p>The missing work must be completed by the end of the add/drop deadline of the semester following the one in which the incomplete was incurred.</p>
<p>A student who withdraws officially from a course after the ten-day add/drop period, but within the first eleven weeks of the term, receives a W (withdrew) grade. If a student withdraws from a course during the last five weeks of the semester, he or she will receive an F (failure) in the course. A student who withdraws officially for medical reasons receives a W regardless of the time of withdrawal. The W grade is not used in computing averages.</p>
<p>The symbol N/F is used in cases where a student registers for a course but does not attend or participate in the course and then fails to withdraw properly. It is assigned 0 quality points and is used in the GPA.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="graduatio-honors-commencement">
	Graduation, Honors, and Commencement 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>The College awards the following honors to members of the graduating class. These senior honors are intended for students with four years of residence at Gettysburg College; grade point average computations are based on four years' performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Valedictorian - to the senior with the highest accumulative average.</li>
<li>Salutatorian - to the senior with the second highest accumulative average.</li>
<li>Summa Cum Laude - to those seniors who have an accumulative average of 3.90 or higher.</li>
<li>Magna Cum Laude - to those seniors who have an accumulative average of 3.70 through 3.89.</li>
<li>Cum Laude - to those seniors who have an accumulative average of 3.50 through 3.69.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Academic Standing Committee may grant the above honors to students with transfer credit if they have satisfied the conditions of the honor during at least two years in residence at Gettysburg College and have presented excellent transfer grades. To arrive at a decision, the Committee will factor in all grades earned at other institutions and during off-campus study programs.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, departments may award Departmental Honors for graduating seniors based upon their academic performance in a major field of study. Departmental Honors are awarded to transfer students on the same terms as to other students, as computation for this award is not necessarily based on four years in residence at Gettysburg College.</p>
<p>Participation in the May Commencement exercises shall be limited to those students who have completed all graduation requirements by that Commencement ceremony.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="honor-code">
	Honor Code 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>In May of 1957, the Faculty approved in principle an Honor Code and accepted in fact a Constitution for the Honor Code at Gettysburg College. With these measures, the Faculty delegated to the Honor Commission responsibility for the regulation of student academic conduct. The final responsibility for the regulation of student conduct remains with the Faculty. The current version of the Honor Code is the result of substantial revision approved by the Faculty, Honor Commission, and Student Senate in 2006.</p>
<p>The Gettysburg College Honor Code articulates the relationship between our shared values of honesty and integrity and our mission as an institution devoted to learning and the pursuit of knowledge. In short, this mission depends on trust and trust requires honesty and integrity. The entire College community is enjoined to actively support our principles of honesty and integrity as summarized in the Gettysburg College Pledge:</p>
<p>I affirm that I will uphold the highest principles of honesty and integrity in all my endeavors at Gettysburg College and foster an atmosphere of mutual respect within and beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>For information about responsibilities to support the principles of the Honor Code and information about procedures for addressing breaches of the Honor Code, students should consult the full text of the Honor Code and the summary in the next section or at the following website: <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/honorcode">http://www.gettysburg.edu/honorcode</a><span><br/></span></p></div></div>
<h3 id="honor-societies">
	Honor Societies 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p><h3>Phi Beta Kappa</h3>
<p>Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, is the oldest Greek-letter society in America and exists to promote liberal learning, to recognize academic excellence, and to support and encourage scholars in their work. The Gettysburg College chapter was chartered in 1923 and is today one of 270 Phi Beta Kappa chapters in American colleges and universities, twenty of which are in Pennsylvania. The Gettysburg College chapter elects to membership about ten to fifteen percent of the senior class who have distinguished academic records and exhibit high moral character and intellectual curiosity. Election to Phi Beta Kappa is perhaps the most widely recognized academic distinction in American higher education.</p>

<h3 id="suspension-leaves-reinstatement">
	Suspension, Leaves of Absence, and Reinstatement 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>Students are expected to be enrolled continuously from their matriculation through graduation. Understanding that unexpected events may occur, however, the College allows for leaves of absence. If a student withdraws from a course during the last five weeks of the semester, the student will receive an F (failure) in the course unless granted a withdrawal for approved medical reasons.</p>
<p>For enrollment accounting purposes, all students will be withdrawn after 180 days from the last day of class attendance. Students who have been suspended, placed on leave, or withdrawn do not have to reapply for admission to the College, but they may be required to submit information for review and approval before being reinstated. Any such requirements will be set forth when the suspension or leave is initiated. Students may also voluntarily, permanently withdraw from the College.</p>
<p>Students who have been suspended, placed on leave, or withdrawn may not remain on campus, may not participate in College activities, and may not visit campus.</p>
<p>Gettysburg College reserves the right to initiate or require a leave or suspension for academic, disciplinary, medical, or behavioral reasons and reserves the right to defer or refuse reinstatement or return.</p>
<h2>Suspensions</h2>
<p>A student may be suspended for academic or disciplinary reasons. Please refer to the College policy on Academic Standing for additional information on academic related suspensions or the Student Code of Conduct for additional information on disciplinary related suspensions. At the time of suspension, the student will be notified of the semester that the student may be eligible for readmission to the College. A student academically suspended for a second time is not eligible for readmission.</p>
<h2>Leaves of Absence</h2>
<p>The College has three types of leaves of absence: Personal, Medical, and Behavioral (College-Initiated). All leaves are administered through the Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services. To initiate a leave of absence, a student must submit a leave of absence request form to the Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services. A student who is on leave may petition the Academic Standing Committee to transfer credit for courses taken at another institution. Proposals for such study <strong>must</strong> be submitted in advance to the Registrar for review by the Academic Standing Committee. All leaves will be refunded in accordance with the College’s refund schedule. For further details about regulations and policies, consult the Academic Advising website. For information about refunding of tuition and fees, please consult Student Accounts or the <a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/academic-programs/curriculum/catalog/policies/policy-details?id=c3e7a2e9-dff2-4da0-b770-01574e81aa56">Withdrawal and Leave of Absence Refund Policy.</a></p>
<p>1) Personal Leave. A student may request a Personal Leave at any time. If the College has information to suggest that a Medical Leave is appropriate, however, the College may refer the request to Health and Counseling for review and recommendations. At its discretion, the College may transmute a Personal Leave into a Medical Leave.</p>
<p>2) Medical Leave. Medical Leave requires the support and approval of Health or Counseling Services. All applications for medical leave are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Students who are hospitalized during the semester require approval from Health or Counseling before being allowed to return to campus. Students may be advised to take a health leave following hospitalization, pending review on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Students who are granted a Medical Leave are expected to be on leave for any remainder of the current semester and for the subsequent semester. Students who are granted late course withdrawals from some but not all courses are generally expected to take a Medical Leave for the subsequent semester.</p>
<p>3) Behavioral Leave (College Initiated). The College will apply the procedures outlined in this policy to determine, at its discretion, whether a Behavioral Leave is necessary. Behavioral Leave generally carries the expectation that: a) student is withdrawn for the remainder of the current semester and the subsequent semester; and, b) completes associated requirements before being allowed to return to campus. Students are normally encouraged to consider a voluntary leave before the College initiates a Behavioral Leave. The College may implement Interim Measures (see “Interim Measures” below) during this process. Alcohol and Other Drugs leaves are addressed separately in the Student Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>The College may initiate a Behavioral Leave if, in the judgment of the Dean of Students’ Office, the student meets one or more of the following standards:</p>
<ol>
<li>The student’s behavior compromises the health and safety of self or others. This may include behavior that necessitates unreasonable measures to ensure the student’s and/or others’ wellbeing.</li>
<li>The student’s behavior is disruptive to others. This includes behavior that causes emotional, psychological or physical distress substantially above that normally experienced in daily life or that disrupts College operations.</li>
<li>The student fails to comply with an assessment, intervention or Medical Leave recommended by the College because of academic, medical, or behavioral concerns. Where the recommended assessment is impossible, as with the student’s failure to comply, indirect behavioral observations will constitute the basis for judgment.</li>
<li>The student requires specialized care or interventions to manage behavioral issues that the College cannot reasonably provide.</li>
<li>The student is enrolled but has a pattern of class absences demonstrating failure to maintain their enrollment status (full- or part-time).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Procedures for a Behavioral Leave</h3>
<p>Any individual who believes that a student meets one or more of the standards described above should contact the Dean of Students’ Office, which will refer the matter to an administrator designated as the Coordinator of the student’s case. The Coordinator will appoint other personnel to form a Review Committee, which the Coordinator heads.</p>
<p>The Review Committee may require an assessment of the student by a medical/psychiatric provider on- or off-campus to determine if the student meets the standards above. An assessment is not required in determining whether the standards above have been met, however. The Review Committee will consider all medical, psychological, observational and academic reports submitted with regard to or on behalf of the student that are relevant to determining the appropriateness of a Behavioral Leave. Treatment and evaluation reports should include information pertaining to diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. With the information available, the Review Committee will also determine if a reasonable accommodation can be made to maintain the student’s enrollment.</p>
<p>If the Review Committee concludes that the student does not meet any of the standards for a Behavioral Leave, it will inform the student in writing and this process will terminate. Generally, a member of the Review Committee will meet with the student to consider appropriate alternatives, including a behavioral contract or disciplinary action.</p>
<p>If the Review Committee concludes that the student does meet one or more of the standards for a Behavioral Leave, the Review Committee will notify the student of its decision in writing and will include reasons for its conclusion. The Review Committee’s decision will become effective immediately.</p>
<h3>Appeal Process for a Behavioral Leave</h3>
<p>A decision reached by the Review Committee may be appealed by the student to the Dean of Students’ Office within five (5) calendar days of the decision. Such appeals should be in writing and include specific points the student wishes the Dean of Students’ Office to consider. The Dean of Students’ Office has five (5) calendar days to review the information presented and inform the student of the decision in writing. The Dean of Students’ Office may (1) uphold the decision of the Review Committee, (2) adjust the finding, (3) refer the matter back to the Review Committee for further proceedings, or (4) reverse the decision of the Review Committee and reinstate the student. The appeal decision is final. </p>
<h2>Interim Measures</h2>
<p>To ensure the safety of individual students and the community, the College may take interim measures while working through disciplinary and Behavioral Leave reviews. Interim measures include residential separation or relocation, class schedule changes, restrictions from College activities and/or facilities, work or job assignment changes, “no contact” directives, temporary separation from the College, a health evaluation (see “Health Evaluation” below), or other measures to ensure the well-being of all students.</p>
<h2>Health Evaluations</h2>
<p>Health evaluations must address 1) attendance dates of the evaluation and any previous dates of contact; 2) a description of the evaluation procedures (tests, interviews, etc.); 3) specifics about recommended courses of treatment; 4) an opinion about the fitness of the student to return to residential living OR suggestions for alternative arrangements; 5) an opinion about whether and under what circumstances the student appears to represent a danger to self or others. Based on the information submitted, the Director of Health or Counseling may refer students for additional evaluation if it is determined by the Director that more information is needed to determine eligibility for reinstatement.</p>
<p>Students undergoing health evaluations must sign releases of information that allow 1) their medical/psychiatric providers to communicate with Health and/or Counseling Services; and, 2) Health and/or Counseling Services to communicate information to College Life. Releases are available on the Counseling Services website at <a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/offices/health-counseling-services/counseling-services/general-releases">https://www.gettysburg.edu/offices/health-counseling-services/counseling-services/general-releases</a></p>
<p>Note that securing a valid health evaluation can take weeks; thus when a health evaluation is required, the student may be advised/required to take a leave.</p>
<h2>Process for Reinstatement after Suspension or Leave</h2>
<p>Students must resolve all incomplete coursework before they will be permitted to return from leave.</p>
<p>Students placed on Suspension or Leave must follow the requirements set forth in writing at the time they left. Failure to do so or to provide accurate and complete information is grounds for denying reinstatement. Return may include stipulations concerning class schedule, extracurricular activities, place of residence or other conditions as may be judged to be in the best interest of the student and the College community. While the College seriously considers the opinions of external individuals (medical providers, e.g.), the ultimate decision about reinstatement belongs to the College. Thus, a recommendation for return from a student’s healthcare provider(s) is not in itself sufficient grounds for reinstatement.</p>
<p>Students may participate in upcoming registration activities after being officially approved for reinstatement.</p>
<p>All students wishing to return from suspension/leave must notify the Office of Academic Advising and Student Support Services of their intent to return per the following dates:</p>
<p>Notification to Academic Advising</p>
<p>Suspension April 15 for fall return</p>
<p>November 1 for spring return</p>
<p>All other leaves May 1 for fall return</p>
<p>November 1 for spring return</p>
<p>All students must then submit required supporting materials (set forth in writing at the time the leave was taken) to these offices by the designated dates:</p>
<p>Suspension Academic Advising May 15 for fall</p>
<p>Dec 1 for spring</p>
<p>All other leaves Counseling &amp; Health June 1 for fall</p>
<p>December 1 for spring</p></div></div>
<h3 id="registration">
	Registration 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>Students must be registered officially for a course in order to earn academic credit. By formally registering for courses, the student pledges to abide by College regulations. Students may also enroll in a course for credit during the first ten days after the beginning of the semester. Students may not enroll in a course after the ten-day enrollment period.</p>
<p>Many departments establish limits to class enrollments in particular courses to insure the greatest opportunity for students to interact with their instructors and other students. As a result, students cannot be assured of enrollment in all of their first choice courses within a given semester.</p>
<p>The College may withdraw a student from classes and withhold transcripts and diplomas for failure to pay college charges. The College may deny future enrollments for a student with a delinquent account.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="residence-requirements-schedule-limitations">
	Residence Requirements And Schedule Limitations 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>The normal program consists of eight courses per year, with four courses in each semester. (Thus, a student will complete graduation requirements in four years of full-time academic work in the September-through-May academic year.) A minimum of sixteen course units must be taken at Gettysburg College or in an approved College program. The last full year of academic work must be completed as a full-time student. Unless given approval, students may not complete requirements as part-time students during their last semester of residence.</p>
<p>Students proposing to complete graduation requirements in less than four full years must have their programs approved by the Academic Standing Committee through the Office of the Registrar. Such approval should be sought at least a year before the proposed completion of requirements.</p>
<p>A full-time student for academic purposes is one carrying a minimum of three courses during a semester. No student who is a candidate for a degree may take fewer courses than this without permission of the Academic Standing Committee.</p>
<p>After the first semester, students may enroll in five courses in any two semesters without petitioning for the right to do so; after two such five course unit enrollments, students will have to petition to overload. For the purposes of determining a full load of four courses, summer internship credit recorded in a subsequent semester will not count. The four course load will apply to study abroad programs. In all cases, students will be allowed to pre-register for only four one-unit courses, and those eligible for an overload may add a fifth course unit during the start-of-term registration period.</p>
<p>Majors and minors in music must take quarter courses, in addition to the normal course load. Other students may take quarter courses in applied music, with the approval of the music department at an additional charge.</p>
<p>A student may audit informally any College course with the permission of the instructor. No charge will be made for such an audit and no record of auditing will appear on the student's transcript.</p>
<p>The College offers a limited opportunity for students to register for and complete a course of study during the summer. Primarily these are off-campus individualized study or internship courses and are arranged through academic departments.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="special-interest-dual-degree-programs">
	Special Interest and Dual Degree Programs 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p><h3>Special Interest Programs</h3>Students may petition the Academic Standing Committee for permission to take courses at another college, university or study site that offers a program in a special interest area not fully developed at Gettysburg College. Examples of special interest areas are urban studies, media and communication, and journalism. Interested students should consult the Office of the Registrar.</p>
<p><h3>Dual-Degree Programs</h3>For all of our Dual-Degree programs, once Gettysburg students apply for and are accepted to an affiliated university, they become students of that university while retaining an affiliation with Gettysburg College through graduation. Students who qualify for financial aid at Gettysburg College are not guaranteed a similar financial aid package at our affiliated universities. Financial aid at the affiliated university must be applied for directly through that university. All other services will also be provided by that university.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="transcripts">
	Transcripts 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>The College supports students in their candidacy for graduate or professional school admission or in their search for appropriate employment by providing a responsive transcript service. Requests for transcripts must include the student's written signature and should be directed to the Office of the Registrar. There is no charge for this service unless special handling is required. The College reserves the right to deny a student's request for a transcript when there is a debt or obligation owed to the College or when there is an unresolved disciplinary or honor code action pending against the student.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="transfer-credit">
	Transfer Credit 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>This policy applies to all courses presented for transfer to Gettysburg College except those completed through the Central Pennsylvania Consortium or through an affiliated program administered by the Center for Global Education.</p>
<p>After enrolling at Gettysburg College, students may transfer a maximum of three course credits. Transfer credit may be presented at the time of matriculation. After matriculation, all transfer credit must be pre-approved by the Office of the Registrar. Students entering Gettysburg College as a transfer student must satisfy all additional course requirements and a minimum of 16 course credits at Gettysburg College or through a regular College-approved program of off-campus study.</p>
<p>Credit for academic work completed at another institution may be awarded based upon the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Student must arrange for the transfer institution to send an official transcript to the Gettysburg College Office of the Registrar.</li>
<li>Transfer institutions within the United States must be regionally accredited. Institutions outside of the United States must be recognized as degree granting institutions by their home country. International transcripts may require a third-party evaluation by World Education Services (WES) or the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) International Education Services.</li>
<li>Credit of at least two semester hours or three quarter hours and a grade of C- or better (or its equivalent) must be earned to be eligible for transfer.</li>
<li>Courses must be similar to Gettysburg College courses in content, method of instruction, and rigor. Online, hybrid, distance learning courses: Normally credit is not accepted for courses without regular meeting times, or contact time with the course instructor. Transfer credit for this type of course can be considered on an individual basis only with the support of the appropriate department chair.</li>
</ol>
<p>To insure that a full load under another credit system equates to a full load at Gettysburg College, the following conversion scheme applies to students presenting more than three transfer course credits for evaluation:</p>

<h3 id="admission-evaluation-criteria">
	Admission Evaluation Criteria 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>Gettysburg College students come from a wide variety of backgrounds and  secondary school programs. The College encourages applications from students of  differing ethnic, religious, racial, economic, and geographic backgrounds who  have demonstrated a capacity for academic achievement, responsiveness to  intellectual challenge, eagerness to contribute their special talents to the  College community, and an awareness of social responsibility. Such persons give  promise of possessing the ability and the motivation that will enable them to  profit from the many opportunities that Gettysburg College offers.</p>
<p>Since admission is highly competitive, the admission staff gives careful consideration to each application. Its decisions are based on two categories of evidence described below.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence of high academic achievement as indicated by the secondary school record.</strong> <br/>Gettysburg College considers grades in academic courses, quality and distribution of subjects, and rank in class as highly significant parts of the applicant's credentials. Participation in accelerated, enriched, honors, International Baccalaureate and advanced placement courses is highly desirable. The College regards superior facility in the use of the English language and an understanding of fundamental mathematical processes as essential to a successful college experience.</p>
<p>It also assumes graduation from an approved secondary school or home-school program.</p>
<p>Students also must submit the SAT I of the College Board or the test results of the American College Testing (ACT) program. Strong applicants who believe that standardized tests do not represent their academic achievement can choose to apply testing-optional.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence of personal qualities. <br/></strong>There is high interest in individuals of character who will contribute in positive ways to the College community. In estimating such qualities, the admissions staff relies on what students say about themselves in essays and interviews, and the confidential statements from secondary school principals, headmasters, teachers, and guidance counselors; Essentially, any evidence of in-depth involvement in secondary school activities and/or participation in community affairs is favorably considered in the admission process.</p>
<p>All acceptances by Gettysburg College are conditional and dependent upon students continuing to do satisfactory work in all subjects, avoiding disciplinary circumstances, and earning a secondary school diploma</p></div></div>

<h3 id="home-schooled-student-application-process">
	Home-Schooled Student Application Process 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>Students who have been home-schooled are welcome to apply to Gettysburg College. Although we use the same criteria to evaluate home-schooled applicants as we do for those students applying from accredited high school programs, we do understand that home-school academic backgrounds are distinctive. Candidates for admissions who have been educated in the home must interview with an admissions counselor and include with the application both the accrediting and evaluative documentation mandated by their home state. In order for us to get the best picture of your college preparation, we also ask that you submit the following with your application:</p>
<ul>
<li>A transcript from a reputable home-school      correspondence program, or a detailed roster (including      subject areas studied, texts used, and time spent on each discipline) of academic coursework      at the secondary level. Classes taken during the senior year at      a local two or four year college or university is highly valued and      transcripts should be included with the application.</li>
<li>A short narrative, written by the person other than      yourself who has been most responsible for your academic life, describing      the nature of your secondary-level education. This document should      not be a recommendation, but rather a description of your instruction in      recent years.</li>
<li>In addition to the admissions essay, a graded paper in an academic area of your      choosing is required.</li>
<li>A letter      of reference from a tutor, evaluator, or teacher who is not a family      member.</li>
<li>SAT      and/or Act scores are recommended. We      strongly recommend that home-schooled students submit three SAT II subject      tests, preferably in writing, mathematics, and a third subject of the      student's choosing.</li>
<li>An      interview with an admissions counselor is required.</li>
</ul></div></div>
<h3 id="guest-student-application-process">
	Guest Student Application Process 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>A high school graduate, not a candidate for a degree, may apply for admission as a non-matriculated student. Normally, such a student may enroll in a maximum of two courses per semester and take no more than eight courses as a non-matriculated guest student.</p>
<p>Taking courses as a guest student requires filing an application for guest student status with the admissions office as well as permission of the instructor(s) of the course(s) involved.</p>
<p>A guest student who may later wish to become a candidate for a degree and a matriculated student at Gettysburg must submit an application under regular admission procedures as either a first-year or transfer student. Guest students have the same academic classroom duties and privileges as regular full-time students, but no promise is made in advance that the guest student will be admitted as a candidate for a degree.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="ap-ib-advanced-credit">
	Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Advanced Credit 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>Students who have taken advanced placement courses in secondary school and wish to be considered for advanced credit or placement must take advanced placement tests of The College Board. All entering students who submit a score of four or five on these tests may receive one course credit for each tested area toward the 32-course graduation requirement. Course credit for advanced placement will be lost if a student takes the equivalent course at Gettysburg. Those high school students who have taken regular courses at the college level in regionally accredited junior or four-year colleges may receive credit for these courses.</p>
<p>Gettysburg College recognizes the quality of the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma in the admission process. In addition, the College awards one course credit in each subject area for Higher Level examination scores of five or higher.</p></div></div>
<h3 id="visiting-campus">
	Visiting Campus 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>A campus visit through the admissions office is strongly recommended as it gives prospective students a personal look at the rich opportunities and variety offered in the academic and extracurricular program. Prospective students are welcome to visit the campus for a tour and/or a group session at any time. Interviews may be scheduled between April 1 of the junior year and mid-February of the senior year. Students can arrange an interview, group session, or campus tour by calling the Office of Admissions at 717-337-6100 or 800-431-0803 or scheduling an appointment online. During the academic year, the admissions office is open from 9:00 to 5:00 on weekdays and from 9:00 to 12:00 on Saturdays; summer hours are between 8:00 and 4:30 weekdays.</p>

<p>The College uses an online billing and payment system for Student Account statements and optional online payments. Student account statements are distributed monthly to the student’s official Gettysburg College email address and to anyone designated as an Authorized Payer within the online billing system. Establishing an authorized payer allows someone other than the student to receive and view, and/or make a payment to the student account. Gettysburg College encourages students to consider identifying parents or guardians as authorized payers. Students and their parents/guardians may print a billing statement from the online system if a paper copy is desired. Instructions and the link for authorized payers to access the online billing system are available online on the Student Accounts Webpage.</p>
<p>Students and their parents/guardians may make payments online from a personal checking or savings account (without a fee) or via credit/debit card (with payment of a convenience fee) using the online billing and payment system. PLEASE NOTE: Credit/debit card usage is limited to VISA, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. There will be a convenience fee of 2.75% added to each credit card payment when using this service. This fee is not associated with or passed on to Gettysburg College.</p>
<p>International students may make payment via GBURG Billing by choosing the foreign currency option and following the instructions on the screen and completing the requirements for the funds to be transferred to make the payment. Allow up to 10 days for processing.</p>
<p>International students may also make payments via the Western Union payment link on the Student Accounts webpage.</p>
<p>Payment may also be made in the form of cash, personal check, certified check, or money order. Checks should be made payable to Gettysburg College and should include the student's ID number to ensure proper credit to the student account. Checks should be mailed to Gettysburg College, Student Accounts Office, Campus Box 437, 300 North Washington Street, Gettysburg, PA 17325. Please note: A $30 charge will be assessed for all returned checks and returned online ACH payments.</p>
<h3>Student Financial Responsibility</h3>

<p>Gettysburg College policy provides for the withholding of all credits, educational services, and issuance of transcripts and certification of academic records from any person whose financial obligations to the College (including delinquent accounts, deferred balances and liability for damage) are due and unpaid.</p>
<p><strong>Force Majeure:</strong>  Gettysburg College will not be liable to the Student or the Student’s Parent for any failure or delay in performance under this Agreement, and no default or breach of this Agreement will have occurred, when and to such extent the failure or delay is due to circumstances beyond the College’s reasonable control including without limitation, Acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, loss of power, war, terrorist threat or act, protest or other civil unrest, external disruptions, pandemics or epidemics, labor disruptions, or official governmental or judicial action.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration of Disputes and Venue for Claims:</strong>  In the event that any dispute related to payment of tuition, fees, or any other charges cannot be resolved directly between the College and the student, the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the parties.  The arbitrator shall establish the rules, schedules, and other procedures to be used during the arbitration.  The decision of the arbitrator, absent fraud or plain error of law, shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be enforceable in courts of proper jurisdiction.  In the event that all parties agree that a dispute should not be arbitrated or in the event that any dispute is not arbitrable, then venue for any claim shall be exclusively within the Court of Common Pleas of Adams County, Pennsylvania and/or the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>Waiver of Class Action Rights:</strong> THE STUDENT AND THE COLLEGE AGREE THAT EACH MAY PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR/ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

<p>To assist in payment of past due balances, College and other resources may be available to a student. If a student’s family financial status changes or a student is otherwise unable to make a payment when scheduled, the student is encouraged to contact the Student Accounts Office prior to the scheduled due date to discuss alternative payment arrangements or the Financial Aid office to discuss the potential opportunity for additional aid.</p></div></div>

<h3 id="withdrawal-leave-absence-refund-policy">
	Withdrawal and Leave of Absence Refund Policy 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>A student must notify the Office of Academic Advising in writing that he or she intends to withdraw or request a leave of absence from Gettysburg College. (See withdrawal and leave of absence policy.) The date of withdrawal will be the last day of attendance in classes or of residence in college housing.</p>
<p>Financial aid recipients who leave the College during a term will have their Title IV aid recalculated according to the federal refund requirements, which state: “Up through the 60% point in each payment period or period of enrollment, a pro rata schedule is used to determine the amount of Title IV funds the student has earned at the time of withdrawal. After the 60% point in the payment period or period of enrollment, a student has earned 100% of the Title IV funds he or she was scheduled to receive during the period.”</p>
<p>(See FSA Handbook: Award Year 2019-2020, Volume 5, Chapter 1, pp. 5-3.)</p>
<p>Title IV funds include and will be returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Direct Stafford Loan, Subsidized Direct Stafford Loan, Direct PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), and other Title IV grant funds.<br/><br/>(FSA Handbook: Award year 2019-2020, Volume 5, Chapter 1, pp. 5-106)</p>
<p>Students receiving financial assistance may have a portion of their original award returned to the programs as required by federal regulation and the Gettysburg College refund policy, thus creating a balance due to the College. For this reason, students contemplating withdrawing during a term of enrollment are strongly encouraged to meet with the Financial Services and Financial Aid Office prior to leaving the College.</p>
<h2>Refunds for Tuition, Global Study Tuition* and Program Fees*</h2>
<p><strong>Refunds for the above are calculated as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100 percent, if notice is received by the tenth day of classes;</li>
<li>80 percent, if notice is received by the third week of classes;</li>
<li>50 percent, if notice is received by the fourth week of classes;</li>
<li>25 percent, if notice is received by the sixth week of classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>No refund will be calculated after the end of the sixth week of classes.</p>
<p>*Refunds for Global Study Tuition and Program fees will be based on the affiliated global study program institution’s refund policy. Gettysburg College retains the right to charge the student for any non-recoverable costs due to the students withdrawal from the program.</p>
<p>Refunds for Room charges will be calculated based on the time the student was in their room for the semester.  A credit for the unused time will be applied to the Student Account.</p>
<p>Refunds for Meal plans will be calculated based on the time the student was on campus for the semester. A credit for the unused portion of the meal plan will be applied to the Student Account.</p>

	Meal Plan Policy 
</h3>
<div>

<div><p>First-year students are required to participate in the USA Meal Plan. Transfer students transferring in as a sophomore or higher class year may choose from any plan, initiated members of fraternities living in College owned housing and upper-class students residing in non-apartment style housing are required to enroll in a plan listed as an option for their particular residence hall. Students residing in housing that has no meal plan requirement may choose any meal plan. Please see the Gettysburg College <a href="/offices/dining-services/">Dining Services web site</a> for current meal plan residency requirements. Students who have special dietary needs associated with a medical condition are urged to contact Dining Services for assistance. Dining Services staff members are very familiar with special diets and can provide foods necessary to meet these requirements.<h3> Dining Accommodations</h3> Dining Services offers a variety of dining options for every student. Upperclass students may select Servo Plus, which provides 20 meals per week and includes 125 Dining Dollars per semester, plus free lite fare in the Dining Center. Up-to-date meal plan offerings can be found on the Dining Services webpage at <a href="/offices/dining-services/meal-plan-information/">https://www.gettysburg.edu/offices/dining-services/meal-plan-information/</a>. Dining Dollars and meals are not transferable or refundable and must be used in the semester in which they are purchased.</p>
<p>Cooking is not allowed in residence hall rooms. An important part of the residential experience is the philosophy of “table sharing.” Students are urged to select a meal plan that enables them to eat a majority of their meals in the Dining Center which is an all-you-care-to-eat facility.</p>
<p>ID cards and meal plans are nontransferable and use of someone else’s ID card will be considered theft. Unauthorized entrance into the Dining Center and/or removing food, plates, silverware, trays, cups, mugs, etc. from the Dining Center will be treated as theft. Our no-limits policy in the Dining Center provides students with all they care to eat while in the dining room and does not entitle you to take food from the dining hall for later consumption. Taking items from the Bullet Hole, The Dive, the Commons, and Ike’s without paying will be treated as theft.</p>

<h2 id="degree-requirements">
	Degree Requirements 
</h2>
<div>

<div>
<h2>Credit System</h2>
<p>The course unit is the basic measure of academic credit. For transfer of credit to other institutions, the College recommends equating one course unit with 4 semester hours. Half unit courses equate to 2.0 semester hours. The College offers a small number of quarter unit courses in music and these courses equate to 1.0 semester hour. Half unit and quarter unit courses may not be accumulated to qualify as course units for graduation; however, these courses are included in GPA calculations. Half unit and quarter unit courses may be accumulated to qualify as course units for graduation toward the 36 unit Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Music Education Degrees.</p>
<h2>Requirements for the Degree</h2>
<p>The College confers four undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.), and Bachelor of Music Education (B.M.E.). The general graduation requirements are the same for all degree programs except where indicated for B.Mus., and B.M.E degree students.</p>
<ul>
<li>32 course units (may include a maximum of 1.00 unit of music ensembles and 1.00 unit of music applied lessons)</li>
<li>36 course units for the B.Mus. and B.M.E. degrees</li>
<li>Minimum accumulative GPA of 2.00 and a GPA of 2.00 in the major field</li>
<li>Fulfillment of the goals of the Gettysburg Curriculum</li>
<li>Minimum of the last year of academic work as a full-time student in residence at Gettysburg College or in an approved College program.</li>
<li>Discharge of all financial obligations to the College</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of the specific courses that may be used to satisfy the curricular goals may be found on the Registrar's web page. Curricular goals may be satisfied, with or without course credit, by students who can qualify for exemption. (See <a href="/academic-programs/curriculum/catalog/policies/policy-details?id=6bae1304-0c75-4cfe-870f-c00b6cb5b753">Exemption from Degree Requirements</a>). Individualized study courses and internships may not be used to fulfill curricular goals.</p>
<h2>The Gettysburg Curriculum</h2>
<p>The overarching goal of the Gettysburg College Curriculum is the development of lifelong learners who</p>
<ul>
<li>Are able to acquire and process information and ideas in multiple ways</li>
<li>Are integrative thinkers</li>
<li>Are skilled in communication</li>
<li>Are prepared for the responsibilities of informed citizenship</li>
</ul>
<p>Students demonstrate their progress toward achieving these goals through their performance in a range of courses or comparable faculty-sponsored experiences, their completion of a major field of study, and their ability to demonstrate connections across the curriculum.</p>
<h3>Multiple Inquiries Goal</h3>
<p>The development of an understanding of multiple frameworks of analysis and of proficiency in reading texts that span the breadth of human expression. The divisional requirements are designed to begin this process of development. Students must take:</p>
<ul>
<li>One course in the division of the arts</li>
<li>One course in the division of the humanities</li>
<li>One course in the division of the social sciences</li>
<li>Two courses in the division of natural sciences, at least one of which must have a laboratory component (B.Mus. and B.M.E. degree students complete one science course with lab)</li>
<li>One course in quantitative, inductive, and deductive reasoning</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these courses, students encounter the perspectives and modes of inquiry and analysis that characterize academic disciplines, an encounter that continues in greater depth in the major field of study.</p>
<h3>Integrative Thinking Goal</h3>
<p>The development of a critical and open mind that seeks to adopt well-argued points of view through the active consideration and integration of alternative methodologies, perspectives, and foundational presuppositions. This process of development receives special emphasis in the curriculum in three different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Interdisciplinary/Course Cluster Requirement, normally completed by the end of the sophomore year, in which students take two designated interdisciplinary courses or a two-course cluster that emphasizes interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary approaches to a common theme. The Course Cluster is a noncredit integrative experience connecting two courses that is graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U). Through these experiences, students gain an understanding of the connections and tensions among approaches to common issues, texts, and phenomena.</li>
<li>The Capstone Requirement, a course or faculty-sponsored experience in which students bring together what they have learned in their major curriculum and demonstrate mastery over the chosen area of concentration.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effective Communication Goal</h3>
<p>The development of proficiency in writing, reading, and the use of electronic media. Central to these skills is the ability to articulate questions clearly, identify and gain access to appropriate kinds of information, construct cogent arguments, and engage in intellectual and artistic expression. Emphasis on this goal begins in the first year of study and continues in the major.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-Year Writing Requirement, a course that introduces students to the essentials of college-level writing. The course may be Introduction to College Writing (ENG 101), a specially designated First-Year Seminar, or an introductory course in a particular discipline.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Major Field Communication Requirement, a course or series of courses or experiences through which students demonstrate they have learned the communication conventions of their chosen field of study. The means through which students will learn these conventions and demonstrate their mastery are determined by the individual departments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Writing Policy</h3>
<p>Since the ability to express oneself clearly, correctly, and responsibly is essential for an educated person, the College cannot graduate a student whose writing abilities are deficient. Instructors may reduce grades on poorly written papers, regardless of the course, and, in extreme cases, may assign a failing grade for this reason.</p>
<h3>Informed Citizenship Goal</h3>
<p>The development of the skills, understandings, appreciations, and moral dispositions enabling students to be committed members of and meaningful contributors to their local, national, and global communities. Three requirements have been developed to assist students in achieving this curricular goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Second Language Requirement. All students must complete one year of language study or its college-level equivalent, as a college graduation requirement. The two-course sequence will be in the same language. International and other students who learned in a language other than English during the final three years of secondary school may petition for exemption from the second language requirement. Please contact the <a href="/offices/registrar/">Office of the Registrar </a>for additional information.<br/>(All B.Mus. degree vocal performance students are to complete four courses in language, one year minimum studying each in two of the following approved languages: Italian, French, German, Spanish)</li>
<li>Cultural Diversity Requirement, two courses designed to help students develop a comprehensive understanding of human diversity by a focus on cultures, roles and experiences of peoples who have historically been underrepresented in the curriculum, and/or on analysis of the construction of social identity and social difference. Students must take one Global Understanding course that has a principal focus people of Africa, Asia (including the Middle East, but excluding European Russia), the Caribbean, Latin America, and/or indigenous peoples. These courses will help students to engage the distinctive ways in which the identified people(s) view, experience, and/or act in the world. Students must also take one Conceptualizing Diversity course with a focus on the experiences of groups that have been marginalized due to race/ethnicity, gender, religion, class, sexuality, age, different ability, etc. Key themes typically include a combination of inequality, power, privilege, subaltern agency, intersection of identities, and/or social justice. These courses will help students pay attention to marginality in society, whether in the US or elsewhere.</li>
<li>Science, Technology, and Society Requirement, one course with a focus on the methodological analysis, historical context, or discussion of the social ramifications of some aspect of natural science or technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>A major field of study, including a capstone experience. (See Major Requirements following this section.)</p>
<p>No course used to obtain a bachelor's degree elsewhere may be counted toward the requirements for a Gettysburg College degree.</p>
<p>Each student is responsible for being sure that graduation requirements are fulfilled by the anticipated date of graduation. The College normally requires students to complete degree requirements in effect at the time of their original enrollment and the major requirements in effect at the time that students declare the major at the end of the first year or during the sophomore year.</p>
<h2>Major Requirements</h2>
<p>Each student must successfully complete the requirements in a major field of study. Most majors consist of eight to twelve courses and may include specific courses from one or more other departments and/or programs. No more than twelve courses may be required from a single subject area, with the exception of the B.Mus. and B.M.E. degrees. Since the general graduation requirements are essentially the same for all degree programs, students completing the major requirements leading to two different degrees must choose which degree to receive at graduation. (Requirements of the various majors are listed in the department and program introductions in the Courses of Study section.)</p>

<h2>Academic Internships</h2>
<p>Gettysburg College students have the opportunity to participate in internships during their four years of study. All students who wish to participate in an internship should schedule an appointment with a career counselor in the <a href="/offices/center-for-career-engagement/">Center for Career Engagement</a>, which maintains information on internship sites located in both the United States and abroad, as well as resources that can connect students to even more opportunities. The Center staff will also educate and assist students in looking for an internship site in their geographic location of preference. Internships taken for academic credit are carefully designed to provide a program with a substantial academic component, as well as practical value. These interns are generally advised by a faculty member within a student's major field of study. Academic credit is awarded by the appropriate department once the student completes the requirements of the department. Internships provide students with a valuable opportunity to apply academic theory to the daily task of business, nonprofit, and government settings. This experience also helps students identify career interests and gain valuable work experience. Students are encouraged to begin the process of finding an internship early in their college career.</p>

<div>

<li><span>AFS-130 </span><span>Introduction to African-American Studies</span><div>Consideration of African Americans within the broader context of the African Diaspora. Students are introduced to a broad range of themes in their historical context, from the African origin of world civilization to the formation of African American societies and cultures. Other themes include the enslavement of Africans, rise and fall of slavocracy, Civil Rights and Black Power struggles, and the emergence of African-centered scholarship and praxis.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-131 </span><span>Introduction to African Studies</span><div>Introduction to the study of the history and culture of various regions and groups in Africa.  This course focuses on both the actual history and culture and how these have been portrayed from different intellectual perspectives.  Topics covered include, African philosophical beliefs; an examination of the slave trade, the participants and its impact; political traditions and systems in Africa; economic systems and the impact of, and resistance to imperialism.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-132 </span><span>Introduction to Caribbean Studies</span><div>Sunny skies, white sands, and mixed drinks with a dash of Bob Marley: that's the image many have of the Caribbean. Once the preeminent site of imperialist expansion and a major cog in the development of capitalism, the Caribbean now sits at the margins of the global economy. This multi-disciplinary course will traverse a geographically tiny, yet politically, historically, and culturally rich terrain. This course seeks to enliven the many other aspects of life in the Caribbean outside of tourism; it will commence with the historical influences of the Indigenous peoples as well as the colonizers, and cover contemporary issues such as international and sustainable development, climate change, race-based politics, and syncretic art forms and religions.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-215 </span><span>Race, Language, and the American Media</span><div>Pop culture provides us with the stories, images, and scripts that enable us to imagine and practice racial identities.  These images and practices, in turn, are imbued with gender and sexuality values and characteristics as well. The racial and ethnic norms generated by popular culture are reproduced in the ways in which audiences both perform and navigate racial terrain in their own lives. Media consumers absorb these norms in the ads they see, the movies/television they watch, and the music they listen to.  This course enables students to do critical thinking about these images, practices, and stories.  AFS 215 and CIMS 215 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-221 </span><span>Francophone African Women Writers: Breaking the Mold</span><div>A study of Francophone African literature by major women authors.  The course covers themes pertinent to the contemporary representation of African society and women’s place in it.  A small and accessible body of post-colonial and critical theory supplements the works of fiction to help place the novels in their literary and cultural context.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-224 </span><span>African American Religions</span><div>Examination of the religious traditions of black Americans from 'slave religion' to the present. Course focuses on the religious beliefs of African Americans and the ways those beliefs have been used to develop strategies to achieve freedom and justice. Subjects covered include the influence of African religion, African American religious nationalism, Pentecostalism, spirituals and gospel music, and the Civil Rights movement. Offered in alternate years.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-225 </span><span>The Haitian Diaspora in Fiction</span><div>Study of the evolving identity of Haitians from the diaspora through careful reading of literary works from Haitian diasporic writers. The focus is on the experience of the protagonists who are exiled, and subsequently need to negotiate their past roots as independent Haitians with their new identity as displaced subjects in Europe or North America.  Major emphasis is placed on the study of literary texts, but the historical context is also covered as well as themes such as slavery, racism, post/colonialism, women, displacement, trauma, disaster and death.  A small and accessible body of postcolonial and critical theory supplements the works of fiction, and will help place the novels in their literary and cultural context.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-236 </span><span>Mapping Caribbean Identities</span><div>Study of the evolution of the Caribbean people from colonial to post-colonial times through careful reading of literature.  Course includes novels from the English, Spanish, and French Caribbean.  A small and accessible body of post-colonial theory supplements the works of fiction.  Focus is on the different political, economic, and cultural realities imposed on the various islands and their populations by the respective colonizing powers. AFS 236 and LAS 223 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-240 </span><span>Race and Slavery in the American South from 1619-1860</span><div>Exploring the diverse, complex, and coercive forms of enslavement from European contact to the beginning of the American Civil War---This  is the line of inquiry that runs through this course. Recovering the experiences  of the enslaved offers students an opportunity to see how systems of oppression did not mute black voices. Primary sources, especially memoirs, are essential to this class. Material and visual culture of enslaved people also figures prominently in class research projects.  Racial theory provides students a chance to see how ideologies of oppression arise out of specific, but changing historical circumstances, a critical learning goal of this course.  CWES 240 and AFS 240 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-244 </span><span>Jazz: African American Classical Music</span><div>Jazz is appropriately considered to be African American classical music because 1) its major innovators are black; 2) it is acknowledged as a uniquely American art form, and, 3) like European and Asian classical musics, it stresses virtuosity, is performed by professionals, and (nowadays) is meant primarily for listening. This course surveys the development of jazz in relation to African American history and aesthetics, addressing socio-political contexts as well as musical style.  AFS 244 and MUS_CLAS 244 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-246 </span><span>Human Rights Policy and Practice in the Caribbean</span><div>“Everyone has the right to leave any country”; “Everyone has the right to work and to receive equal pay for equal work”; “Everyone has the right to education”: These are excerpts from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), a document adopted in 1948. This course involves exploration of the rise and spread of human rights; various human rights policies and practices in different parts of the world, with an emphasis on the Caribbean.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-247 </span><span>History of African American Music</span><div>A survey of the history of African American music in the United States, beginning with a perusal of music in Africa and the Caribbean and tracing its development from spirituals to hip-hop.  Disciplinary perspectives range from ethnomusicology (the study of music in its cultural context) to anthropology, religious studies, critical race theory and gender studies.    No previous academic experience with music is required.  Cross-listed with AFS 247.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-248 </span><span>African American Women Writers</span><div>Survey of  poems, essays, novels, short stories and plays written by African American women.  Starting with late 18th century poet Phillis Wheatley and ending with 1993 Nobel Prize Laureate  Toni Morrison, we investigate the political, social, and aesthetic concerns with which these women writers contend: spiritual conversion; woman's labors under slave bondage; reconstructing the womanhood and family ties in the post-Emancipation Era; protest against racist violence, specifically lynching and rape; black women's moral reform movement; racial passing and socioeconomic mobility; government challenges to black women's reproductive rights; and collaborative methods to organize black women-centered communities. Cross-listed with AFS-248. Offered occasionally. Fulfills humanities and conceptualizing diversity requirements.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-250 </span><span>Topics in Africana Studies</span><div>Rigorous, detailed examination of the philosophical and intellectual traditions that shape a common social heritage shared by Africans and African Americans.  Course assumes a cultural perspective toward human organization to understand the social dimensions of the historical and contemporary ordering and governance of the African life by systems of religious, economic, and educational thought. Fulfills either the Global Understanding or Conceptualizing Diversity requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-251 </span><span>Topics in Musicology: Global - Music of the Caribbean</span><div>An examination of music in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and Trinidad.  Disciplinary perspectives come from ethnomusicology (the study of music as culture), Africana Studies, and Latin American Studies.  Covers recreational musics (such as reggae and  salsa) as well as religious musics (such as bata drumming) in relation to  broader  cultural currents such as national identity, race, social class, gender, sexuality, and religion.   MUS 251, AFS 251, and LAS 251 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-256 </span><span>African Economic History and Development</span><div>In this course, we explore the economic history and development of Africa, focusing on theories, methods, empirical analysis and key debates. We examine the external and internal, institutional and resource-based explanations of the region's development from pre-colonial period to the modern economy. We will consider the role of development practitioners such as international financial and trade institutions, nongovernmental bodies, and global governance institutions.
Africa is a large and diverse continent, better understood through an appreciation of individual country development experiences – many countries on the continent remain underdeveloped while others have achieved emerging status. As such, we will make use of country case studies and current events to better understand the differences and similarities of the effects of both policy responses, resource and institutional constraints.  Prerequisite: ECON 103 and 104; ECON 241 recommended.  AFS 256 and ECON 256 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-262 </span><span>Africa in Fiction, History, and Memory</span><div>A critical examination of the literary, filmic, historical, and memorial representations of Africa. The course traces and analyzes the politics that informs the cultural constructions of Africans as people who live in particular spaces and times. The course compares various African(ist) literary, cinematic, and historical traditions and maps out the areas of convergence and differences as far as the representation of Africa is concerned. Engaging with history as a discipline, it highlights alternative ways in which intellectuals and laypeople have laid claim to the interpretation of the African past. Finally, moving away from Euro-centrism, the course emphasizes cultural productions of African writers, film directors, and public historians to show that Africans are not just subjects of history; they are equally agents of historical representation in its various guises.  AFS 262 and HIST 273 are cross-listed.  Offered as staffing permits.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-264 </span><span>Education for Social Change</span><div>This course explores how schooling has made us the people that we are today, and asks if formal education has prepared us for the challenges that we face in this age of globalization. The course assaults the status quo nature of education and challenges us to imagine a pedagogy that is central to social change. This interrogation of education is not meant to raze the entire historical edifice to the ground, but rather to lead us to critically reflect on the far too frequent manifestations of dull educational processes that produce conformists, rather than inspire us to creatively overturn structures of inequities.  AFS 264 and EDUC 264 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-267 </span><span>Race, Gender and The Law</span><div>A study of how U.S. law has dealt with African Americans and Women, from their status as property to the current cases about affirmative action and 'reverse discrimination.'  Includes an introduction to Critical Race Theory and Critical Feminist Theory as approaches to viewing the law.  Each student will work with their own Supreme Court case, wrestling not only with the legal concepts contained in the case, but the historical context from which it arose, with both a broad (national) and local (parties to the case's community) focus, as well as who represented whom and how were they paid, applying theory in a direct and practical fashion.  Offered as staffing permits.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-270 </span><span>The Postcolonial Condition: Race, Gender &amp; Identity in the Caribbean</span><div>After World War II, decolonization gained momentum across the world, and in its wake, emerged many newly-minted sovereign nation- states. Most countries in the Caribbean became independent in the 1960s, yet the Caribbean has remained a geo-political space demarcated by rupture, fragmentation and disjuncture. Myriad races/ethnicities (including indigenous, European- mostly English, Spanish, French, Dutch-, Africans, Indians, Chinese, Syrians and Lebanese) came together in the Caribbean under the rubrics of colonialism, slavery and indentureship. In this course we will spend considerable time exploring many theories of postcoloniality around the world, then connect them to various fragments of postcolonial life in the Caribbean, centering on issues of race/ethnicity, gender and identity.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-274 </span><span>Globalization and its Discontents: The Caribbean Case</span><div>Globalization is one of today’s buzzwords. It is at once everywhere and sometimes nowhere. It is a maddening nexus of seeming contradictions.  Although the course utilizes the Caribbean as a case study for many of the issues pertaining to globalization processes, it also pays close attention to global forces that connect seemingly divergent locales. In essence, from week to week, the course shifts from the macro to the micro and back. This affords a more comprehensive sense of the complicatedness of both the homogenizing trajectory of globalization as well as the disjunctures it engenders. The course spans disciplines and topics such as history, political economy, sociology, international relations, culture, media, (im)migration, environment, race, class, and gender.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-280 </span><span>African American English: Language in Black and White</span><div>Investigation of the variety of English referred to as African American English (or Ebonics) with specific focus on the following areas: grammatical structure, pragmatics, history, and educational issues.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-290 </span><span>Language, Race and Education</span><div>An exploration of the educational consequences of linguistic and cultural diversity and a broad overview of sociolinguistic topics, with the goal of introducing students to current issues in the field. Topics include language contact and language prestige, multilingualism and bidialectalism, communicative competence, language and social identity, code switching and diglossia, language socialization and language ideology and their consequences for educational policy and practice.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-318 </span><span>Africana Music: Juju to Hip Hop</span><div>An interdisciplinary perusal of issues surrounding Africana musics ranging from African music such as juju to Afro-Caribbean styles such as salsa and African American forms such as jazz and hip-hop.   This discussion-oriented course calls upon perspectives from Africana studies, ethnomusicology (the study of music in its cultural context), anthropology, religious studies, history, philosophy, critical race theory, gender studies, and literary criticism.  Cross-listed with AFS 318.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-321 </span><span>Francophone African Women Writers: Breaking the Mold</span><div>A study of Francophone African literature by major women authors.  The course covers themes pertinent to the contemporary representation of African society and women’s place in it.  A small and accessible body of post-colonial and critical theory supplements the works of fiction to help place the novels in their literary and cultural context.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-325 </span><span>The Haitian Diaspora in Fiction</span><div>Study of the evolving identity of Haitians from the diaspora through careful reading of literary works from Haitian diasporic writers.

A small and accessible body of postcolonial and critical theory supplements the works of fiction, and will help place the novels in their literary and cultural context.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-331 </span><span>Africana Intellectual History</span><div>Exploration of the evolution, links, and applications of black thought in the Atlantic World.  Efforts toward political, economic, and social change in the African Diaspora are examined through the lenses of various ideologies and historical contexts, such as black emancipation and nationalist movements, black and African feminism, and global expansion of hip hop culture.  Students conduct extensive analysis and discussion of oral traditions and primary writings, stretching from Sundiata to C. L. R. James, Sojourner Truth to Franz Fanon, and Frederick Douglass to Angela Davis.  AFS 331 and HIST 274 are cross-listed.  Offered every other year.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-346 </span><span>Human Rights Policy and Practice in the Caribbean</span><div>“Everyone has the right to leave any country”; “Everyone has the right to work and to receive equal pay for equal work”; “Everyone has the right to education”: These are excerpts from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), a document adopted in 1948. This course involves exploration of the rise and spread of human rights; various human rights policies and practices in different parts of the world, with an emphasis on the Caribbean.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-348 </span><span>Advanced Topics in Africana Studies</span><div>Examinations of the political, cultural, historical, or economic experience and expressions of the people of the African Diaspora. Topics numbered 348 fulfill cultural diversity domestic conceptual, 349 fulfill cultural diversity nonwestern and 350 fulfill either goal.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-349 </span><span>Advanced Topics in Africana Studies</span><div>Examinations of the political, cultural, historical, or economic experience and expressions of the people of the African Diaspora.

From slavery to the death penalty, from cocaine sentencing to hate crime prosecutions, no other group has been punished more.  In the practice of law, while other groups suffer from a glass ceiling, for black men it is bulletproof Plexiglas.  This course will address the causes, conditions, and consequences of this separate and unequal treatment of black men by the law.  Offered as staffing permits.</div><br/></li><li><span>AFS-370 </span><span>The Postcolonial Condition: Race, Gender &amp; Identity in the Caribbean</span><div>After World War II, decolonization gained momentum across the world, and in its wake, emerged many newly-minted sovereign nation- states.

The course analyzes the international and transnational politics of assisting Africans in their quests for a better life. The course also examines the various ways in which aid provision and volunteering have constructed Africa as the ultimate “paradigm of difference.¿? It assesses the impact of aid and volunteering on African societies and investigates the possibility of alternative approaches to aid provision. The course finally explores how Africans have historically been instrumental in the development/modernization of their respective societies.  AFS 375 and HIST 375 are cross-listed.

</h4>
<div>

<li><span>ANTH-103 </span><span>Introduction to Cultural Anthropology</span><div>Comparative study of social practices and cultural systems, using a series of case studies of non-Western and Western cultures, including our own. Course gives overview of history of cultural anthropology, major questions and theoretical debates, fieldwork and research methods, and the relevance of anthropology to the modern world. No prerequisites.</div><br/></li><li><span>ANTH-106 </span><span>Introduction to Archaeology</span><div>Study of how archaeologists and physical anthropologists reconstruct what people's lives were like in the past.  Course uses case studies drawn from historical and ancient societies to examine how archaeology and physical anthropology contribute to anthropology's goal of understanding and comparing human behavior, religious beliefs, political structure, social organization, and economy.  Students are introduced to the range of materials that archaeologists and physical anthropologists study, including burials, buildings, monumental art, trash, and texts; and to important theoretical concepts and methods. No prerequisites.</div><br/></li><li><span>ANTH-205 </span><span>Primate Behavior &amp; Human Origins</span><div>Introduction to the anthropological study of human origins.

</h4>
<div>

<p>
	For students enrolled at Gettysburg College in or after Fall 2019 
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The Department of Management offers a major in <strong>Business, Organizations, and Management</strong> for students enrolled at Gettysburg College in or after Fall 2019; a major in <a href="/academic-programs/management/programs/oms-majors">Organization and Management Studies (OMS)</a> for students enrolled prior to Fall 2019; and a <a href="/academic-programs/management/programs/business-minor">minor in Business</a>. 
</p><p>
	The Business, Organizations, and Management major offers a dynamic interpretation of business, management, and organizations by utilizing a critical management perspective to better understand their relationship with contemporary society. Although the fundamentals of business and management are still relevant, the ever-changing environment of business, globalization, and the impact on society requires a more fluid and analytical understanding. The Department of Management encourages students to use the skills and knowledge they will gain to analyze contemporary issues in a critical manner that is unfettered by traditional frameworks. Workers, communities, and social justice are given equal consideration with profit and shareholder returns. 
</p><p>
	The Business, Organizations, and Management major is anchored in the social sciences, and reaffirms the central role of the liberal arts in studies of business, organizations, and management. Critical thinking, rigorous inquiry, and the acquisition of knowledge are central to the Business, Organizations, and Management major. The curriculum stresses intellectual boldness, creative problem solving, entrepreneurial thinking, and the practice of socially responsible management. It is an ideal major for anyone aspiring to a management or leadership position in business, government, the nonprofit sector, or any other organizational environment.

	The Business, Organizations, and Management major is designed to give students not only a solid grounding in core principles of business, but to do so within a framework that extends beyond traditional pedagogical views for studying and teaching business. Students will rely on a critical managerial perspective for understanding and analyzing the evolving relationships of businesses with local, national, and global constituencies. 
</p><p>
	Students who major in Business, Organizations, and Management will take microeconomics, accounting, organizational behavior, statistics, research methods, marketing, and ethics. Business, Organizations, and Management majors will also have the opportunity to explore the critical analysis of corporate finance, marketing, business law, entrepreneurship, small business management, and business policy and strategy. In addition, they can choose to critically study the complex relationships among individuals, policies, and structures within business and organizations through courses on organization theory, systems thinking, decision making, as well as topics related to the future of work, organizational culture, human resource management, leadership, employee motivation, and well-being. 
</p><h2>
	Critical Action Learning Experience 
</h2><p>
	Students in the Business, Organizations, and Management major should complete an applied, substantive experience outside the classroom before beginning their senior year, referred to as a Critical Action Learning (CAL) Experience. This can be accomplished through global study programs with the Center for Global studies, a registered internship with the Center for Career Engagement, and immersion projects with the Center for Public Service. Once the experience is completed, students are responsible for writing an 8-10 page reflection paper about the experience that is contemplative, introspective, and incorporates theories and empirical literature from the field of Critical Management Studies (CMS). Students will work with their Management Faculty Advisor to complete a reflection paper upon conclusion of the CAL experience.
</p><p>
	For students relying on internships to meet the CAL experience requirement, please see details for registering the internship and documenting the experience. Once the CAL experience and reflection paper are successfully completed, the student will receive a satisfactory grade for the internship (if applicable) and “credit” towards the BOM major.
</p><p>
	Please note that neither the CAL assignment, nor the internship credit count towards one of the 32 course credits required for graduation.

<div>

<li><span>CWES-205 </span><span>Introduction to the American Civil War Era</span><div>Interdisciplinary introduction to the Civil War Era (roughly 1848-1877) in American history. Student is introduced to the basic history of the Civil War, with an emphasis on the fundamental causes of the war, the war years themselves, both at home and on the battlefield, and Reconstruction period. Assigned readings include a mix of primary sources and a basic survey text.  History majors may count CWES 205 as a major course.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-210 </span><span>Civil War Memory: Race, Politics, and Commemoration</span><div>An exploration of the complex, contentious and frequently contradictory ways that memories of the Civil War have reverberated in American culture from the immediate postwar years through the present day. Taking race, politics, and commemoration as primary lenses, the course will devote significant attention to the ways historical figures used the diverse landscapes of public memory – including battlefields, works of art, monuments &amp; memorials, cultural programs, fiction and film – in an ongoing struggle to define the meaning and legacy of the war.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-212 </span><span>Narratives of Illness</span><div>This course has two objectives: firstly, to conduct an interdisciplinary investigation of the various ways that the medical profession, patients, and the state narrate illness; secondly to chart the history of medicine and public health, paying particular attention to the changing roles of doctors, the history of disease causation, and how these two phenomena overlap especially in the mid to late nineteenth century.  While this course covers a broad chronology, it focuses on the Civil War era, which gave rise to sanitary principles and provided the foundation for the bacteriological revolution at the end of the nineteenth century.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-215 </span><span>Introduction to War Studies</span><div>This course introduces students to the study of warfare from an interdisciplinary context. Students will approach the subject of war through five distinct perspectives: the philosophy of war; the history of war; the experience of war; war, culture, and society; and the memory of war. The overall goal of the class for students to develop a sophisticated approach to the study of war through an interdisciplinary way of analyzing conflicts both in the past, but also, in our present. By the end of the semester, students will endeavor to answer the following questions: what is war; how does war affect participants/victims; how do societies remember war?</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-225 </span><span>Cameras, Canvas &amp; Cannons: Visual Culture of the Civil War Era</span><div>This course examines American visual culture in the Civil War period, encompassing painting, sculpture, prints, and photography. It treats works that directly depict aspects of the conflict, and those that address how everyday life and perceptions of what it meant to be American were shaped by the war and its aftermath. We examine how the making and circulation of images shifted during this pivotal period.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-237 </span><span>From Reconstruction to Black Lives Matter</span><div>Despite the ratification of Constitutional amendments after the Civil War, which provided Black people with both citizenship and voting rights, there has been both legal and customary efforts to block Black people from gaining access to these rights.  This course examines those prohibitions but it also centers how Black people have responded; and in so doing it charts the rise of Black protest from the Reconstruction period to Black Lives Matter.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-240 </span><span>Race and Slavery in the American South from 1619-1860</span><div>Exploring the diverse, complex, and coercive forms of enslavement from European contact to the beginning of the American Civil War---This  is the line of inquiry that runs through this course. Recovering the experiences  of the enslaved offers students an opportunity to see how systems of oppression did not mute black voices. Primary sources, especially memoirs, are essential to this class. Material and visual culture of enslaved people also figures prominently in class research projects.  Racial theory provides students a chance to see how ideologies of oppression arise out of specific, but changing historical circumstances, a critical learning goal of this course.  CWES 240 and AFS 240 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-245 </span><span>Gettysburg to Charlottesville: Race in the American Imagination</span><div>Study of the role of Civil War history and mythology in America's self-understanding and its continuing problem of race. Integrating Civil War Era Studies, Literature, Film Studies, and Political Science, the class seeks to understand the Jim Crow Era, the Civil Rights Movement, and the elections of 2008 and 2016. The class centers on the book and movie, Gone With The Wind, but will view other significant films pertaining to "race and reunion."</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-250 </span><span>Topics- Civil War Era Studies</span><div>Topics course in Civil War Era Studies</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-305 </span><span>Global Epidemics: From Subjugation to Science</span><div>his course examines how physicians throughout the British and American empires in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries depended upon populations of dispossessed people of color in Africa, the Caribbean, the American South, India, Latin America, and other parts of the world to advance new theories about the cause of disease transmission.  CWES 305 and HIST 305 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-310 </span><span>War in the Nineteenth Century</span><div>This is a course designed to give students and understanding of the nature of war on a global scale during the nineteenth century. Students will study the history of specific conflicts – their origins and nature – but also the ways in which war changed and transformed over the course of the ‘long’ nineteenth century. The hope for this course is that students who are interested in the American Civil War can gain further appreciation of the political and military changes associated with an age marked by conflicts of state formation and imperial expansion.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-320 </span><span>Aftermath: The Experience of War and ‘Modern’ Memory</span><div>This is a course that will examine, primarily, two conflicts in modern history and their lasting representations in cultural history and literary memory.  Wars have long cultural legacies.  Both the American Civil War and First World War changed not only the ‘war generation’ of each conflict, but also, demonstrate case studies of the representation of war and the polemics of memory within nation states.  In this class students will engage with the cultural and military histories of two different conflicts and compare their lasting impact in our contemporary perception of war and society. As such, the ‘experience of war’ will be our broad topic of consideration.  We will access this theme by examining memory sources that detail and represent these experiences over time.  The class’s methodological themes will address the following: conceptions of victory and defeat, the memory of participants and their representations of war, the writing of history and the mythologies created by conflicts and their chroniclers. By studying the cultural history of combat and its aftermath, students will learn something about the way history is written and historical events depicted over time. Through interdisciplinary representations of war in film and literature, it is hoped that students will gain an understanding of the changing perceptions of wars, within the conception of modern memory.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-337 </span><span>Reconstruction and the Legacy of the American Civil War</span><div>An exploration of the various aspects of Reconstruction, including political conflicts over how the defeated South would be treated, the struggle over civil rights for African Americans, an overview of Reconstruction historiography, the  contested nature of Civil War memory, and the enduring legacy of this vital yet often overlooked period of our past.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-340 </span><span>Mark Twain's Civil War</span><div>Soldier in the Confederate Army, Connecticut Yankee, friend of U.

<li><span>CWES-205 </span><span>Introduction to the American Civil War Era</span><div>Interdisciplinary introduction to the Civil War Era (roughly 1848-1877) in American history. Student is introduced to the basic history of the Civil War, with an emphasis on the fundamental causes of the war, the war years themselves, both at home and on the battlefield, and Reconstruction period. Assigned readings include a mix of primary sources and a basic survey text.  History majors may count CWES 205 as a major course.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-210 </span><span>Civil War Memory: Race, Politics, and Commemoration</span><div>An exploration of the complex, contentious and frequently contradictory ways that memories of the Civil War have reverberated in American culture from the immediate postwar years through the present day. Taking race, politics, and commemoration as primary lenses, the course will devote significant attention to the ways historical figures used the diverse landscapes of public memory – including battlefields, works of art, monuments &amp; memorials, cultural programs, fiction and film – in an ongoing struggle to define the meaning and legacy of the war.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-212 </span><span>Narratives of Illness</span><div>This course has two objectives: firstly, to conduct an interdisciplinary investigation of the various ways that the medical profession, patients, and the state narrate illness; secondly to chart the history of medicine and public health, paying particular attention to the changing roles of doctors, the history of disease causation, and how these two phenomena overlap especially in the mid to late nineteenth century.  While this course covers a broad chronology, it focuses on the Civil War era, which gave rise to sanitary principles and provided the foundation for the bacteriological revolution at the end of the nineteenth century.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-215 </span><span>Introduction to War Studies</span><div>This course introduces students to the study of warfare from an interdisciplinary context. Students will approach the subject of war through five distinct perspectives: the philosophy of war; the history of war; the experience of war; war, culture, and society; and the memory of war. The overall goal of the class for students to develop a sophisticated approach to the study of war through an interdisciplinary way of analyzing conflicts both in the past, but also, in our present. By the end of the semester, students will endeavor to answer the following questions: what is war; how does war affect participants/victims; how do societies remember war?</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-225 </span><span>Cameras, Canvas &amp; Cannons: Visual Culture of the Civil War Era</span><div>This course examines American visual culture in the Civil War period, encompassing painting, sculpture, prints, and photography. It treats works that directly depict aspects of the conflict, and those that address how everyday life and perceptions of what it meant to be American were shaped by the war and its aftermath. We examine how the making and circulation of images shifted during this pivotal period.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-237 </span><span>From Reconstruction to Black Lives Matter</span><div>Despite the ratification of Constitutional amendments after the Civil War, which provided Black people with both citizenship and voting rights, there has been both legal and customary efforts to block Black people from gaining access to these rights.  This course examines those prohibitions but it also centers how Black people have responded; and in so doing it charts the rise of Black protest from the Reconstruction period to Black Lives Matter.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-240 </span><span>Race and Slavery in the American South from 1619-1860</span><div>Exploring the diverse, complex, and coercive forms of enslavement from European contact to the beginning of the American Civil War---This  is the line of inquiry that runs through this course. Recovering the experiences  of the enslaved offers students an opportunity to see how systems of oppression did not mute black voices. Primary sources, especially memoirs, are essential to this class. Material and visual culture of enslaved people also figures prominently in class research projects.  Racial theory provides students a chance to see how ideologies of oppression arise out of specific, but changing historical circumstances, a critical learning goal of this course.  CWES 240 and AFS 240 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-245 </span><span>Gettysburg to Charlottesville: Race in the American Imagination</span><div>Study of the role of Civil War history and mythology in America's self-understanding and its continuing problem of race. Integrating Civil War Era Studies, Literature, Film Studies, and Political Science, the class seeks to understand the Jim Crow Era, the Civil Rights Movement, and the elections of 2008 and 2016. The class centers on the book and movie, Gone With The Wind, but will view other significant films pertaining to "race and reunion."</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-250 </span><span>Topics- Civil War Era Studies</span><div>Topics course in Civil War Era Studies</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-305 </span><span>Global Epidemics: From Subjugation to Science</span><div>his course examines how physicians throughout the British and American empires in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries depended upon populations of dispossessed people of color in Africa, the Caribbean, the American South, India, Latin America, and other parts of the world to advance new theories about the cause of disease transmission.  CWES 305 and HIST 305 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-310 </span><span>War in the Nineteenth Century</span><div>This is a course designed to give students and understanding of the nature of war on a global scale during the nineteenth century. Students will study the history of specific conflicts – their origins and nature – but also the ways in which war changed and transformed over the course of the ‘long’ nineteenth century. The hope for this course is that students who are interested in the American Civil War can gain further appreciation of the political and military changes associated with an age marked by conflicts of state formation and imperial expansion.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-320 </span><span>Aftermath: The Experience of War and ‘Modern’ Memory</span><div>This is a course that will examine, primarily, two conflicts in modern history and their lasting representations in cultural history and literary memory.  Wars have long cultural legacies.  Both the American Civil War and First World War changed not only the ‘war generation’ of each conflict, but also, demonstrate case studies of the representation of war and the polemics of memory within nation states.  In this class students will engage with the cultural and military histories of two different conflicts and compare their lasting impact in our contemporary perception of war and society. As such, the ‘experience of war’ will be our broad topic of consideration.  We will access this theme by examining memory sources that detail and represent these experiences over time.  The class’s methodological themes will address the following: conceptions of victory and defeat, the memory of participants and their representations of war, the writing of history and the mythologies created by conflicts and their chroniclers. By studying the cultural history of combat and its aftermath, students will learn something about the way history is written and historical events depicted over time. Through interdisciplinary representations of war in film and literature, it is hoped that students will gain an understanding of the changing perceptions of wars, within the conception of modern memory.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-337 </span><span>Reconstruction and the Legacy of the American Civil War</span><div>An exploration of the various aspects of Reconstruction, including political conflicts over how the defeated South would be treated, the struggle over civil rights for African Americans, an overview of Reconstruction historiography, the  contested nature of Civil War memory, and the enduring legacy of this vital yet often overlooked period of our past.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-340 </span><span>Mark Twain's Civil War</span><div>Soldier in the Confederate Army, Connecticut Yankee, friend of U. S. Grant, favorite speaker at Grand Army of the Republic Reunions. Mark Twain called himself "not an American, but THE American." No American author wrote more incisively about race, war, reconstruction, and the American Way. Mr. Clemens fought his own personal civil war against Mark Twain, and lost.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-450 </span><span>Individualized Study-Tutorial</span><div>Individualized tutorial counting toward the minimum requirements in a major or minor, graded A-F.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-460 </span><span>Individualized Study-Research</span><div>Individualized research counting toward the minimum requirements in a major or minor, graded A-F.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-470 </span><span>Individualized Study-Internship</span><div>Internship counting toward the minimum requirements in a major or minor, graded A-F.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-475 </span><span>Summer Internship</span><div>Summer Internship graded S/U, counting in the minimum requirements for a major or minor only with written permission filed in the Registrar's Office.</div><br/></li><li><span>CWES-477 </span><span>Half Credit Internship</span><div>Half credit internship, graded S/U.</div><br/></li></div>

In a risk society, where two major pillars of modern society (scientific knowledge and nation-states) exhibit their limitations, citizens are compelled to reexamine their relationships with other citizens, nature, and science and technology.  Education, which had propelled modern nations’ economic development by preparing and providing a competitive workforce, must also go through fundamental changes. Using Fukushima nuclear disaster as an example, this course will guide students to examine risks that are relevant to our lives, what it means to live in a risk society, and what educational changes are necessary in the wake of such a societal shift.

	Engineering - Dual Degree

<h4 id="engineering-program-description">
	Program Description 
</h4>
<div>

<p>Gettysburg College's engineering dual-degree program combines the enhanced communication skills and creativity of a liberal arts education with the focused rigor of a highly regarded engineering program.</p><p>Gettysburg College offers dual-degree engineering programs in conjunction with Columbia University in New York City, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p><p><a href="/academic-programs/physics/pdf/2021/Dual Degree PhysicsDeptBrochure 2021.pdf">Dual Degree Engineering Program (PDF)</a></p><p>Upon successful completion of the program, the student is awarded the bachelor–of-arts degree from Gettysburg and the bachelor-of-science degree in an engineering discipline from one of the four affiliated universities. Since the student graduates with two degrees, all degree requirements from both institutions must be completed, including a major at each institution. The Gettysburg College major can be in any discipline provided the student completes the pre-engineering courses and the Gettysburg College curricular requirements before starting at the engineering school. The affiliation agreement between schools allows many courses to transfer so that the student can complete both degrees in 5 years. American students who qualify for financial aid at Gettysburg College will usually be eligible for similar aid at the engineering affiliate universities. International students who qualify for aid at Gettysburg are not guaranteed financial aid, although it is sometimes available.</p><p>In addition to their college advisor, candidates for this program are advised by the Engineering Advisor who is a member of the physics department. Normally, a student will be recommended to Columbia, RPI, Washington University, or Pitt during the fall semester of the junior year. Under the typical "3-2" option, students spend three years at Gettysburg and two at the partner institution.</p><p>Links:</p><p><a href="http://engineering.wustl.edu/DualDegreeProgram.aspx">Washington University at St. Louis</a></p><ul>

</ul><p>The grade requirements for guaranteed admission are different for each program, but at a minimum students need a 3.0 GPA to be recommended. However, admission to Columbia University will no longer be guaranteed for the students enrolling in Fall 2019 and thereafter. The specific courses required for admission by each affiliated institution vary and students should schedule courses in close cooperation with the Engineering Adviser at Gettysburg.</p><p>All dual-degree engineering students must take Physics 111, 112, 211 or Physics 109, 110 (depending on engineering field this is likely the preferred option for non-physics majors); Mathematics 111, 112, 211, (plus 212 and 225 for many engineering fields); Chemistry 107; and Computer Science 107 or 111 (depends on engineering field). Students interested in Columbia University should also take Economics 103 or 104. All dual-degree engineering students must complete the Gettysburg College curricular requirements while at Gettysburg. We recommend that 3-2 students begin working on their Gettysburg College major their first year.</p><p>While the 3-2 option is considered typical, our affiliate schools also allow the 4-2 option, whereby students complete four years at Gettysburg before transferring.  In both cases the student receives two bachelor degrees at the end of the program.  For financial aid reasons it is strongly recommended that students delay their Gettysburg College graduation until the end of their work at the engineering school (the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> year depending whether 3-2 or 4-2).  Both 3-2 and 4-2 students are allowed to march at the Gettysburg College graduation with their graduating class even if they are not graduating provided certain criteria are met.</p><p>Some students choose to transition to engineering by finishing 4 years at Gettysburg College and then applying to graduate schools in engineering.  In this case students can apply to a broad range of schools, though some of our affiliate schools have special programs our students can consider.  The graduate school option changes the financial aid picture as the student would no longer be an undergraduate.  In addition, skipping the undergraduate degree in engineering usually prevents the student from sitting for professional licensure exams.</p><p>Yoshi Sato Engineering Advisor</p></div>

We will also examine Shakespeare's plays in their own time, attempting to understand how they were influenced and influenced the culture of early modern England. Because he was so attuned to the everyday lives of Elizabethan Englishmen and women, he was able to explore the deeply felt interactions of human society and imaginatively recreate characters with an unprecedented complexity and emotional realism. We will seek to understand the power with which his creations spoke the theatregoers four hundred years ago and continue to speak to us today. Fulfills humanities requirement and English department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-212 </span><span>Survey of  English Literature: Medieval &amp; Renaissance</span><div>Selective survey of medieval and early modern English literature from the likes of Beowulf through the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603 - almost a millennium.  The goals of the class are to introduce students to several major writers and works of these centuries, to give an outline of the development of the literature, and to help develop skills in reading critically and discussing and writing about literature. Fulfills humanities requirement and English department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-213 </span><span>Medieval Epic Literature</span><div>Course replete with folkloric, legendary, and mythic elements which can be linked to an evocative material record.  These traditions are chock-full of gods and goddesses, heroes and villains, monsters, magic, trickery, and treachery.  Begins with a discussion of the natures of oral narratives and of mythic archetypes, and an introduction to theoretical concepts which aid in understanding the cultural functions of storytelling and mythmaking; students then move on to discuss the development of Medieval Epic literary traditions founded upon far earlier oral materials. Fulfills humanities requirement and English department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-214 </span><span>C17th English Drama</span><div>This course will chart the development of English drama from Shakespeare to Gay.  Our exploration of the drama will include the thematic, the dramatic, and the theoretical and will be informed by an understanding of early modern history and culture.  Students will read works by Marlowe, Shakespeare, Kydd, Jonson, Dekker, Milton, Etherege, Congreve, and Gay and think about the role the theater -- public, private, and closeted -- played in early modern England. Offered occasionally. Fulfills humanities requirement, and English department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-215 </span><span>Literature and Politics in Early Modern England</span><div>Poets, playwrights, and essayists in the early modern period were often in the thick of political intrigue, dispute, and faction. The playwright Christopher Marlowe was rumored to be a spy and an atheist and was killed in a mysterious bar fight that many attribute to his political involvement. John Milton not only is responsible for the great epic poem Paradise Lost, he was also jailed for his involvement in the English Civil War. We will study the interplay between early modern texts and their political contexts, investigating the role of drama, poetry, and prose in the power of the state and the ideological conflicts that abounded during this period. In the process we will be interested in the manner of political expression and resistance during this period, from the court-influenced writings of Thomas More and Edmund Spenser to the wonderfully equivocal public poetry of Andrew Marvell, as well as the central influence that literature and the printed text generally had on the rapidly changing politics of early modern England.   Fulfills humanities requirement and English department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-216 </span><span>The Thief with a Heart of Gold? The Fact &amp; Fiction of Robin Hood and the Myth of the Outlaw Hero</span><div>Course charts the development of Robin Hood, beginning with the earliest sources and analogues; after exploring how this misty medieval figure became a commonplace of modern popular entertainment, course examines Outlaw Heroes from around the globe. Course explores why Outlaw Heroes in general are popular, as well as why Robin Hood in particular is reborn for each succeeding generation.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-217 </span><span>Global and Radical Shakespeares</span><div>To say that William Shakespeare’s appeal is universal, both timeless and worldwide, is a platitude. This course examines the truth and fiction behind this platitude by having students read several of Shakespeare’s plays alongside rewritings and reproductions of these plays across time periods and across the globe. Our focus will be on the cross-cultural connections and dissonances, as well as the fascinating revisions, that occur when distinct cultures take up these plays and put them to their own purposes. Texts and films may include Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, King Lear and The Tempest, the modern American film Ten Things I Hate About You, the Italian documentary Caesar Must Die, the censored Thai film Shakespeare Must Die, the Japanese masterpiece Ran, and Aime Cesaire’s postcolonial rewriting of The Tempest, Une Tempete.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-221 </span><span>Survey of English Literature:17th &amp;18th Century</span><div>Course examines representative literary works from the period in which England experiences the crisis of civil war, the turn to constitutional government, and the expansion of an overseas empire. The turn to modernity registers in a range of literary forms, from over-the-top Jacobean tragedy to Milton’s epic Paradise Lost, and from the rapidly-developing novel to the witty satires of an expanding public sphere. Class discussion focuses on strategies of close reading, with some attention to historical and cultural context.  Fulfills humanities requirement, and English Department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-222 </span><span>The Unreasonable Age of Reason</span><div>The eighteenth century has been called "The Age of Reason," a designation that implies straight and narrow thinking about straight and narrow subjects.  To those of us who know and love the eighteenth century, it is hardly that.  In Fact, its literature is full of such things as horses that talk like humans, gangs of criminals that sing operatic arias in praise of their "profession," and young men who journey to London in search of adventure and get much more than they bargained for.  Through plays, poems, novels, and personal journals, we will discover just why the "Age of Reason" is a misnomer for the eighteenth century in England.  Offered occasionally.  Fulfills humanities requirement, and English Department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-223 </span><span>Milton and the Eighteenth Century</span><div>Course introduces students to Milton’s masterpiece, Paradise Lost, and reads representative eighteenth-century British texts that respond to and re-imagine the key questions that shape the poem. Representative authors and genres of the period are studied, and students practice basic skills of literary analysis in regular writing assignments that introduce them to resources and research methods in literary studies.  Fulfills Humanities requirement and English Department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-224 </span><span>Gender and Sexuality in 18th Century British Literature</span><div>Eighteenth-century Britain witnessed important changes in the ways in which sexuality and gender roles were defined, from the rise of the “two sex” theory of the body to the development of an ideology of domesticity that continues to shape family and social arrangements today. Literature of the period not only explores such changes but also uses representations of gender and sexuality to mediate broader cultural changes, such as the rise of a credit economy and the shift to a limited monarchy. Rakes ruled the Restoration stage; Joseph Addison threatened to prosecute the hoop skirt for concealing women’s sexual indiscretions; and more than one novel of the period narrates a “harlot’s progress” from iniquity to respectability. This course explores how such representations  helped contemporary readers make sense of their cultural environment and shaped modern identity. Literary readings will be supplemented by short theoretical readings from the history of gender and sexuality.   Fulfills Humanities and Conceptualizing Diversity requirements and English Department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-225 </span><span>Imperial Fictions in 18th-C British Literature</span><div>Course examines how racial, ethnic, and national categories were imagined and represented just as Britain's transatlantic empire was expanding. Works by writers who experienced enslavement and imperial rule are juxtaposed with works in which Britain's imperial identity was written into being. Short historical and philosophical works provide context for literary works that show how imperial ideology developed and was debated and challenged over the course of the long eighteenth century.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-232 </span><span>Romanticism to Modernism</span><div>Students will look at the changing shape of English literature from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century.  At a time when some theorists are asking "Is literary history possible?" we will attempt to understand a small portion of English literary history and some of the terms used to define it: "Romanticism," Victorianism," and Modernism." Among the representative authors, we may study from these three periods are Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Tennyson, Browning, Rossetti, Yeats, Eliot, and Woolf.  Through the fiction and poetry of these authors, we will also explore some of the ideas and anxieties of this age, such as the relationship between science and faith, the role of women, and the impact of colonialism. Offered occasionally.  Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-233 </span><span>Survey of American Literature to 1865</span><div>A chronological study of American writing from colonial days through the present, with some attention to the social, political, and intellectual backgrounds. Primary emphasis during the first half of the sequence falls on the Puritans and American Romantics; the second half surveys writers from the Romantics forward, including such figures as Twain, Chopin, James, Williams, Stevens, Faulkner, Hughes, as well as selected contemporary writers. Offered occasionally. Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-235 </span><span>Survey of African American Literature</span><div>Overview of African American literature from early slave narratives to realist novels and twenty-first  century poetry. This course asks how foundational  nineteenth-century African American writers invented and adapted literary forms to redefine the United States and construct new images of blackness. Further, we explore how their work speaks to our own moment by discussing recent literature,  political discourse, and popular culture. Authors considered will include Phillis Wheatley, Frederick Douglass, Frances Harper, Charles Chesnutt, Claudia Rankine, and Ta-Nehesi Coates.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-237 </span><span>American Realism and Naturalism</span><div>In 1901, Charles Chesnutt observed that the United States "was rushing forward with giant strides toward colossal wealth and world-dominion," an assertion that captures the energy, anxieties, and priorities of the later decades of the nineteenth century.  The nation’s "rushing" vigor, simultaneously exhilarating and troubling, is likewise evident in the period’s literature, which sought to document how vast cultural, technological, economic, and political changes impacted individual American lives.  In this course, we will explore these decades through the works of Rebecca Harding Davis, William Dean Howells, Mark Twain, Henry James, Sarah Orne Jewett, Charles Chesnutt, Pauline Hopkins, Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser, Edith Wharton, and Paul Dunbar, among others. Offered occasionally. Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-238 </span><span>The Early American Novel</span><div>For a variety of reasons -- cultural, political, and logistical -- the development of the American novel is delayed until political independence from England is won.  In this course, we will examine novels written during the early years of the nation, tracing the ways in which the works attempt to define a distinct national identity.  Authors considered will include Brown, Foster, Tenney, Cooper, Sedgwick, Child, Poe, and Dana. Offered occasionally. Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-240 </span><span>Antebellum American Literature</span><div>American literature written between 1830 and 1860 is the focus of this course, a period that has come to be known as the “American Renaissance.”  As students explore the texts and contexts of these three decades, they will consider the implications of this name, what it assumes, and what it excludes.  The reading list will likely include Cooper, Emerson, Poe, Thoreau, Fuller, Hawthorne, Stowe, Douglass, Brown, Whitman, and Melville, among others. Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-241 </span><span>Literature of the Civil War Era</span><div>Course introducing students to American literature written around, or about, the Civil War.  Beginning with a novel rumored (wrongly) to have started the conflict, students read a series of works that engage the political and social turmoil, from both Northern and Southern perspectives.  Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-242 </span><span>Curiouser and Curiouser: Children’s Literature and the Invention of the Modern Child</span><div>Is reading children’s literature work or play? From novels as distinct as The Governess; or The Little Female Academy (1749) and Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (1997) and The Hate U Give (2017), the genre has long navigated the poles of education and entertainment, socializing children alternately as miniature adults, docile innocents, or imaginative rebels. After spending the semester surveying didactic primers, fairytale fantasies, beloved classics, and curious outliers from the Golden Age of children’s literature, we’ll end by asking how modern YA fiction upholds or subverts earlier ideals of childhood. Along the way, we will analyze the social, historical, and pedagogical contexts of our objects of study and ponder the surprisingly large philosophical, psychological, and aesthetic questions raised by these seemingly small texts.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-243 </span><span>Riot, Rebellion, Revolution: The Tradition of Protest in Nineteenth-Century US Literature</span><div>From slave rebellions to civil war, passive resistance to armed revolt, the US experienced regular social upheaval—sometimes peaceful, more often violent—across the nineteenth century. In this course, we will explore what it means that American literature is motivated by protest. Beginning with US responses to the Haitian Revolution and ending with early twentieth-century labor unrest, we will examine the tensions between insurrection and the “domestic Tranquility” promised by the Constitution. Consulting works by authors including Tom Paine, David Walker, Leonora Sansay, Robert Montgomery Bird, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Henry David Thoreau, Harriet Beecher Stowe, John Brown, Charles Chesnutt, Ida B. Wells, and Theodore Dreiser, we will consider the myriad roles protest might play in forming “a more perfect Union.”   Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-250 </span><span>Topics in 20th &amp; 21st Century Literature</span><div>Intermediate study of a variety of authors, themes, genres, and movements during the 20th and/or early 21st centuries.  Courses may cover American, British, transnational, and/or post-colonial literatures.  Fulfills Humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-251 </span><span>Survey of American Literature Since 1865</span><div>Survey of major literary works, produced throughout the world from antiquity to the present, that have had a significant influence beyond their regional and historical origins. While on the one hand, this course aims to introduce students to the respective contexts of these distinct works, thus promoting an understanding of cultural diversity, its primary goal is to research the continuing human concerns that bring together literary traditions. In addition, the course provides students with a literary history of globalization by considering how exploration, colonization, religion, economics, and the circulation of ideas have linked disparate populations. Lastly, it asks important questions about the endurance of literature by examining broader issues such as canonization, translation, publication, dissemination, and digitization. Written assignments will focus on developing critical reading, writing, and thinking skills with a comparative approach. Although this course is taught in English and open to all students, those with reading fluencies in languages other than English will be encouraged to produce their own original translations of primary texts and to pursue research projects that allow them to work multi-lingually. In addition, declared English majors will be encouraged to investigate the wider impact of English language literature outside of Anglophone societies.

Centering our discussions around the social, political, and cultural movements of the 20th century, we will consider the manner by which literature has been utilized to give voice to the reality of African Americans, thereby re-writing narratives that previously sought to exclude and negate them.  This course will engage novels, short stories, poetry, essays, autobiography, and drama as a means of not only exploring African American culture, but also ultimately considering the African American presence as central to understanding American culture as a whole.    Offered occasionally. Fulfills humanities and conceptualizing diversity requirements.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-254 </span><span>American Poetry</span><div>Study of the development of American poetry from 1620 to 1945.

Taking a multi-genre approach, texts will include fiction, poetry, music, autobiography, public speeches, and essays.  We will examine the manner by which the intellectual, cultural, and political elements of the movement are captured and expressed through literature. Moreover, we will consider literary expression as central to furthering the aims of the Civil Rights movement, preserving and promoting its legacy in the contemporary moment, and framing 21st Century movements toward social justice</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-258 </span><span>African American Women Writers</span><div>Survey of  poems, essays, novels, short stories and plays written by African American women.  Starting with late 18th century poet Phillis Wheatley and ending with 1993 Nobel Prize Laureate  Toni Morrison, we investigate the political, social, and aesthetic concerns with which these women writers contend: spiritual conversion; woman's labors under slave bondage; reconstructing the womanhood and family ties in the post-Emancipation Era; protest against racist violence, specifically lynching and rape; black women's moral reform movement; racial passing and socioeconomic mobility; government challenges to black women's reproductive rights; and collaborative methods to organize black women-centered communities.

"Amerika" takes an international approach to the study of American literature.  This course examines the idea of America in relation to the place of the United States, considering how it may be transferred, reflected, perceived, and debated globally, as we read fiction written about the United States by foreign writers.  For some, such as Kafka, this means imagining an entirely fabricated space, whereas for others, such as Nabokov and Lorca, it means critiquing a culture found in a newly-adopted homeland.  Although we will cover early accounts, such as those by Tocqueville and Columbus, the syllabus is weighted toward the 20th century fiction from countries as wide-ranging as Germany, France, Egypt, and Palestine in order to engage current questions about the reception and creation of American culture in the twenty-first century. Offered occasionally. Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-261 </span><span>After Auschwitz: Literature of Witness</span><div>In the decades following the Holocaust, a “poetry of witness” rose into prominence.  This poetry is motivated by the desire to remember and to record the horror, as well as to memorialize those who were silenced.  In “After Auschwitz: A Literature of Witness,” we will read memoirs and poems written by survivors and collaborators of the Holocaust.  Additionally, we will read a memoir and many poems by the next generation of Jews, often the children of survivors. At a moment in history when the last survivors of the holocaust are passing away, it is important that we study and remember their experiences.  Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-262 </span><span>Contemporary African American Literature</span><div>This course will examine the literary and cultural production of African Americans in the 21st Century, considering ways that contemporary African American writers have—through form and content—honored and built upon the expressive traditions that preceded them.  Taking a multi-genre approach, we will also consider the manner by which fiction, poetry, film, essays, and music have presented and reflected upon the contemporary reality of African Americans.  Potential themes and events considered within the literature include: the aftermath of 9/11, responses to Hurricane Katrina, Blackness in the age of Obama, post-Blackness/post-Raciality, African diasporan identity and immigration, identity formation and social media, popular culture, intersectionality, #BlackLivesMatter, and social justice movements of the 21st Century.  Fulfills humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-263 </span><span>Voice and Visibility: African Americans and the Power of Spoken Word</span><div>While the immediate focus of this course will be directed toward the contemporary Hip Hop and Spoken Word Movements, we will engage the contemporary moment as part of an African American cultural legacy that is built upon a bedrock of oral tradition.  We will consider the significance of orality in crafting and cultivating the forms, styles, and content of African American cultural expression.  Examining oral expressions that range from music to public speeches, this course positions the spoken word as central to understanding the complex issues of identity, culture, and politics that shape the African American presence in American society  Offered occasionally.

Special emphasis is given to writers representing the largest segments of the U.S. Latino population: Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans. Other Latino communities are represented in shorter reading selections. This is primarily a literature course engaging students in literary analysis of each text’s themes, structure and style.

Students will analyze novels, short stories, poems, and films to investigate how Latinx cultural production unfolds along the lines of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, and coloniality. As we will see, these issues are explored not only in literary expressions of Latinidad and Chicanidad, but also, and more predominantly, in group-specific epistemologies and modes of consciousness, inextricable from the experiences that co-constitute them, i.e., from the social and historical complexities of racialization and mestizaje; multilingualism and code-switching; immigration and diaspora; revolution and exile; citizenship and undocumented status; labor and economic exploitation. Along the way, students will examine the differences and similarities that have shaped the experiences and aesthetic choices of different Latinx communities in the United States, while thinking more broadly about their transnational contexts in the US-Mexico borderlands, the circum-Caribbean, and Latin America.  ENG 266 and LAS 266 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-267 </span><span>Ethnic American Literatures of the United States</span><div>This course will survey a number of works from African American, Native American, Latinx, and Asian American literary canons. Each unit will investigate how minoritarian experiences are constructed through literary forms and representations across diverse twentieth- and twenty-first-century American literatures. Across units, we will identify literary expressions that grapple with the historical experiences of colonialism and slavery; racialization and double consciousness; ethnic difference and marginalization; dialect and code-switching; migration and diasporic writing; alienation and assimilation. Approaching these issues through the prism of ethnic literature encourages us to consider not only how American identity formation is constituted by a historical legacy of empire, but also how creative writing responds to—and even attempts to disrupt—such a legacy. It also encourages us to consider how a monolithic and even marginalizing category such as “ethnic literature” is itself rife with problematic assumptions about identity and difference, homogeneity and heterogeneity, national culture and multi-culturalism. As we move through each unit, we will examine the differences and similarities across the literatures of various ethnic and racial identities in the United States, while analyzing how they invoke their broader transnational contexts and how they develop complex intersections with issues of class, gender, and sexuality. In this way, we will assess how different ethnic literatures challenge more traditional notions of American cultural production, thereby also challenging our understanding of American identity itself.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-268 </span><span>Empire</span><div>Overview of the concepts and material practices of empire (also known as imperialism) through both global Anglophone literature and pop-culture texts from around the world and across centuries. Starting with Herman Melville’s Benito Cereno (1855) and ending with the hit Fox TV show Empire (2015-2020), this course examines the multiple dimensions of empire, such as the enormous territory possessed by the British empire at its peak to the ways that the United States today is often seen as an empire for its enormous influence in global affairs. And as a transnational literature class, special attention will be paid to the global dynamics of empire as they’re portrayed by both imperial authors and writers who suffered under empire or have critiqued it. No background in empire studies needed—just enthusiasm to learn!</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-270 </span><span>Topics in Genre</span><div>Intermediate study of literature focused on a specific type, or genre, of literature over a broad time-frame.

This course serves as an introduction to the vibrant field of the history of the book, which focuses on the material life of texts and the way that their materiality shapes books’ cultural impact. We will consider the book as a physical object; study the relationship between books and their cultures; and explore links between books and theories of textuality. Along the way, we will explore such issues as the evolving figure of the author, the development of copyright, and how people have experienced their reading of books over the centuries. The over-arching goal is to become attuned to the practical and theoretical consequences of books’ materiality. The work of the course will take advantage of Musselman Library’s Special Collections, and students will have the opportunity to learn about and engage in archival research. This course may appeal especially to students wishing to gain a broad foundation in issues relevant to librarianship and editing.   Fulfills Science, Technology, and Society requirement</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-298 </span><span>Critical Methods:  History of Literary Criticism</span><div>This course will trace changing ideas and assumptions about literature from antiquity to the nineteenth century.  In order to appreciate more fully the various ideas about literary value (broadly conceived), we will consider the arguments in tandem with examples of the specific genres literature being celebrated as exemplary or, in some cases, derided as dangerous.  Throughout the semester, our goal will be to acquire a sense of the historical basis for the practice of literary criticism, as well as an appreciation of the kinds of questions and problems raised by the study of literature.  Students may expect to read selections from some of the following:  Plato, Aristotle, Horace, Longinus, Sidney, Boileau-Despreaux, Pope, Vico, Hume, Burke, Kant, Schiller, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-299 </span><span>Critical Methods</span><div>Introduction to advanced literary study.

The personal essay presents an idea from a personal point of view, requiring both persuasiveness and a distinctive voice.  Students develop a series of essays over the semester, and read a wide variety of published essays for analysis and inspiration. Students are expected to serve as peer critics, and to complete various exercises and revisions in order to write ambitious, compelling essays. Offered occasionally. Prerequisite: English 205.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-305 </span><span>Free Verse &amp; Form in Poetry</span><div>Whether writing in form or free verse, poets make careful choice of sound, diction, and line length.  This course will pay particular attention to the way a poem’s form (the way it looks on the page and sounds to the ear) reflects and amplifies its meaning.  Readings may include poems by James Merrill, Anthony Hecht, Greg Williamson, Linda Gregerson, and Jorie Graham.  Requirements will include seven original poems with revisions, two short papers (“close-readings” of particular poems), and a presentation.  Prerequisite: ENG 205.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-306 </span><span>Writing the Memoir</span><div>Workshop in the reading and writing of memoir.

Prerequisite: English 205.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-307 </span><span>Writing the Screenplay</span><div>An advanced writing workshop in screenplay. The course focuses on reading/viewing as a screenwriter, with attention to craft, including writing and viewing exercises, discussion, and workshop sessions. These activities are in service of developing students' voice and skills as they write the main project of the semester, a feature-length screenplay. Everything students have learned about writing comes into play in this course, and everything learned here helps students with future writing, no matter what they choose to write. Can writing a screenplay help you write a better story, essay, or poem?  Can writing a screenplay help you become the storyteller you want to be? Yes, it can.  Prerequisite: ENG 205</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-308 </span><span>Writing the Literary Review</span><div>This course provides students with the skills necessary to write reviews of literature for print and online publications. Students enrolled in the course will learn how to write both short and long form reviews as well as how to find and choose work to review, how to pitch reviews for publication, where to pitch their articles, how to self-edit, and how to work with editors. At the end of the course, in addition to having written a variety of reviews, all students will have written an actual pitch that they have sent to an editor. Although the focus of this course is on writing reviews of literature — whether fiction, nonfiction, poetry, plays, or hybrid genres — the skills students learn will apply to reviewing other art forms as well. Therefore, part of the course will involve writing reviews of events in the Gettysburg community such as concerts, theatrical productions, gallery shows, architecture, public lectures, et al. Furthermore, “Writing the Review” treats the review as a significant literary genre. As such, it has a heavy reading component; students will be introduced to the long history of the review and exposed to a broad range of contemporary reviewing platforms and publications, ranging from the Times Literary Supplement (TLS) to Avidly. In addition to writing reviews, they will write papers about the reviews they have read. Therefore, this course is open both to creative writing students advancing their writing skills and English students interested in the history and practice of cultural criticism.

Students read examples drawn from a variety of genres of drama, and view performances of several plays on videotape. Class stages its own production of the Noah story. Counts toward Theater Arts major.  Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-313 </span><span>In Search of Beowulf: Fact, Fiction, &amp; Fantasy</span><div>Students in this course explore ancient Denmark and Scandinavia with Beowulf—the archetypal Tough Guy—as guide, maneuvering  a mystical landscape of trolls, dragons, and witches, plying icy waters with Grettir the Strong, tasting Fafnir’s blood with Sigurd the Dragon-Slayer, swearing blood-brotherhood with Boðvar Bjarki, Bear-Warrior, and oh, so much more! Placing the Anglo-Saxon epic in the context of ancient Germanic legend, folklore, and myth, this course helps students to understand the literary geography of the poem, as well as giving them the tools to navigate this topography by introducing them to the rudiments of manuscript study and the Old English language.  Beowulf is well-known to students of English literature everywhere and even the manuscript itself is now readily available through the Electronic Beowulf project. Less familiar, though, are the sites of the epic. The location of the great hall of Heorot has long been postulated to have been somewhere in the vicinity of Roskilde in Denmark. For generations no physical evidence seemed likely to corroborate such suppositions, but recent discoveries at Lejre have reinvigorated this investigation. Archaeological work now is allowing us to place the poem in a physical geography; this opens up more fully our understanding of the world which produced the poem. In addition to a fantastic literary work, therefore, we may now begin to understand Beowulf as an artifact in a historical setting.

But how did people think and write about love four hundred years ago?  This course will explore the flood of love poetry, essays on marriage, and romantic comedies that began in the Renaissance with the Petrarchan poet Thomas Wyatt. What did these authors have to say about courtship, sex, marriage and the opposite sex?  What did they say to capture the interest of their audience?  We will not only be reading representations of more traditional male-female relationships in the drama and love poetry of the period, but also the homoerotic sonnets of Shakespeare, the homosocial poetry of Amelia Lanyer and Katherine Philips, and the strange figurations of divine love in the poetry of John Donne and George Herbert.  Fulfills Humanities requirement and English Department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-315 </span><span>Seventeenth-Century Poetry: Forms and Pressures</span><div>In this course we will investigate the major generic forms and preoccupations of the poetry of the seventeenth-century, a period in which England stood on the verge of our modern world.  This period marked a series of radical changes and conflicts that altered the nature of society, and perhaps more importantly for our purposes, literature as well. Our focus for much of the semester will be on learning advanced techniques for reading and analyzing some of the great poetry in the English language, poetry by John Donne, George Herbert, John Milton and Andrew Marvell. We will study scansion, meter, rhyme patterns as well as a variety of poetic modes and forms. By the end of the semester, you will be expert readers of poetry, as well as better writers of it (if you are so inclined).  As we hone our poetic skills, we will connect our enhanced understanding of these poems to some of the important developments of the century, including: the political upheavals of Civil War and Restoration; the growth and spread of a Protestant and Puritan poetics and politics; the widening public sphere and rising literacy rate; the burgeoning literary marketplace and professionalization of the author; the changing role of women both in the public and domestic spheres; the profound expansion of, and centrality of London to, English culture. This is a tremendously fascinating period in British history, both historically and literarily, and there will be a lot into which to delve.  Fulfills Humanities requirement and English Department Pre-1800 requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-316 </span><span>Medieval Romance</span><div>This ain’t your mother’s Harlequin Romance, baby! Love you’ll find, all right, but not the sappy sentimental kind you might expect, and in these tales battles, dragons, and the knights of King Arthur are every bit as common as lovers’ tears, instant infatuation, and bodice-ripping passion. The genre of the Medieval Romance had its earliest vernacular genesis in French and Anglo-Norman translations of Latin epic poetry, and eventually it evolved into an extremely popular courtly narrative aimed at a secular aristocratic audience. Because of these origins and aims we might expect Romances to deal with the interests and values of the courtly class, and this is indeed often the case: Spectacles of battles, tournaments, feasts, quests, and the hunt abound, along with elaborate descriptions of clothes, arms, armor, and rituals, most notably those related to “courtesy,” or polite courtly behavior. Perhaps the most well-known conventions of the Medieval Romance to modern readers are those of courtly love and “chivalry,” the code of knightly virtue and conduct. These are indeed common facets of the genre, and often Romances in fact might be said to articulate and to validate the cultural values and practices of the elite classes of the Medieval West. The Romance is much more than a mere series of re-assertions of fundamental interests and principles, however, and often it critiques the very cultures it seems designed to laud. The Medieval Romance may be—for these reasons—more difficult to define accurately than it seems upon first inspection.  Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-317 </span><span>Shakespeare and the Early Modern Stage</span><div>What did the original performances of Shakespeare look like, sound like, smell like, feel like? This course attempts to answer this question, studying the performance spaces, the costuming, the acting styles, the lighting of the early modern stage. We will do so while also reading some of Shakespeare’s greatest plays, using our knowledge of the conditions of performance to understand more fully what meanings are being conveyed in these texts.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-318 </span><span>Saga, Myth, and Orality from the Lost Gods of Britain to Contemporary Conspiracy Theories</span><div>Heard any good stories lately? Perhaps from the friend of a friend? All cultures have their stories, and as different as they may be on the surface, most myths and legends have some important similarities, as well as the crucial differences that reflect realities of a given culture and that make a particular story vibrant and unique. Storytelling provides answers to life’s persistent questions: All peoples everywhere ponder the same mysteries, and the answers developed by a particular culture can tell us a lot about that people. A society that worships a thunderbolt-wielding king god may be a warrior aristocracy; one that venerates an earth goddess fertility figure may be agrarian in nature; one that deifies tragic pop icons struck down by their own excesses may be obsessed with cults of celebrity and narcissism, as well as the inviolate sanctity of individual expression. A comparative approach to mythology allows us to grasp the fundamentally human nature underlying story-telling: Thus, although the stories we tell may be different from those of the ancient Sumerians, or those of the Celts, or those of the Sioux, the basic concerns addressed by those stories are often very similar indeed.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-321 </span><span>Restoration &amp; Early 18th Century Literature</span><div>Course focuses on literature written between 1660 and 1743, and examines dominant literary forms and modes, as well as such issues as the education of women and marriage, changing social behavior, and growing consumerism. Through plays, prose writings, diaries, and poetry, students sample the literary richness of the period. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-322 </span><span>Eighteenth-Century British Public Sphere</span><div>In 1675, King Charles II tried to shut down London’s coffee-houses, declaring them dens of scandal and sedition.  In 1710, Joseph Addison declared that he would bring philosophy out of the colleges and libraries into the very same coffee-houses.  This debate over coffee-houses represents one element of a larger contest over the emergence of an eighteenth-century "public sphere," a space for supposedly free debate and investigation that also promised participants the chance to talk their way into a new understanding of both their own social status and their relationship to state authority.  This course will examine how the eighteenth-century British public sphere was thought and brought into being, paying particular attention to the ways its emergence was defined in and by literary texts.  We will also investigate broader questions about how the ways in which individuals imagine their communities and their social relationships helps to define the scope of their agency, and how the debates that structured the eighteenth-century public sphere give us ways to approach the shifts in our own public sphere brought about by the digital revolution and the rise of Web 2.0. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-323 </span><span>The Secret History of the Novel</span><div>Most accounts of novel’s “rise” in eighteenth-century Britain emphasize the genre’s “formal realism” and attribute its development to a triumvirate of male novelists—Defoe, Fielding, and Richardson. But behind and alongside that story exists a “secret history of the novel”: a story largely about fiction by women frequently more salacious, less realistic, and more formally experimental than the mainstream novel. Students will learn about this alternate tradition while practicing skills of formal analysis, historical research, and critical reading and writing.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-324 </span><span>The Eighteenth-Century City</span><div>“When a man is tired of London,” Samuel Johnson famously opined in 1777, “he is tired of life.” In the eighteenth century, London was bursting with life. One tenth of England’s population called it home. Many who migrated to or flourished in London found in the city a way of life that was fresh, exciting, and novel—in short, modern. In this course, we will explore how eighteenth-century cities, from London to Dublin to Philadelphia, give rise to distinctly modern forms of experience. We will examine the role that cities play in the eighteenth-century literary imagination by reading works of poetry, prose, and drama. We will focus on the nature of the individual who inhabits the modern city, and on the people who live in modernity’s shadow, at the margins of the city. Throughout, we will keep in mind Johnson’s further observation that “a great city is, to be sure, the school for studying life.”</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-325 </span><span>Rise of the Novel</span><div>In this course, we will explore what was “novel,” or new, about the formal conventions and the style of the novel; we will examine what questions, problems, and themes preoccupied eighteenth-century novelists; and we will make connections between the novel and its historical and cultural context.  Many of the texts we will be reading were bestsellers in their day, and one of our main tasks will be to understand how these works delighted, absorbed, and scandalized eighteenth-century readers.  We will investigate the early novel's relationship with other forms of prose fiction, and we will explore the relationship between the so-called "realist novel" and some of its alternatives. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-326 </span><span>The Literature of Sentiment</span><div>In the sentimental literature of the late eighteenth century, hearts flutter, pulses race, and ladies swoon.  The fineness of one’s feelings signifies one’s social refinement and one’s moral virtue alike. This course investigates the philosophical and social origins of this shift to sentiment and examines the poetry, novels, and plays in which sentiment circulated in late eighteenth-century Britain. Students will investigate why the late eighteenth century witnesses a shift to the body as a sign of one’s character; how the literature of sentiment represents ideals of masculinity and femininity; how sentiment is used to enforce social boundaries; and assess the reliability of moral judgments grounded in feeling. Fulfills Humanities requirement and English Department Pre-1800 requirement</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-332 </span><span>Moving Through Nineteenth-Century American Narrative</span><div>Nineteenth-century Americans were, seemingly, always on the go.  This course will explore narratives -- novels, poems, plays, and autobiographies -- that represent the possibilities and limitations associated with mobility, broadly understood.  To provide critical perspective on the train trips and sea voyages depicted in these works, we will also explore critical writings on space, place, geography, and mapping. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-333 </span><span>Victorian Aesthetics</span><div>In this course, we will explore the intersection between literature and the visual arts in mid to late Victorian England, with special attention paid to the Pre-Raphaelite, Aesthetic, and Decadent movements.  Beginning with the Great Exhibition of 1851, which celebrated all things English, we will look at the ways architects, artists, poets, craftspeople, socialists, novelists, and dandies sought to breathe life into an era which many felt had become unbearably materialistic, mechanistic, and downright ugly.  Throughout the course, we will try to understand how the search for beauty can have profound political, social, and even economic implications.  Counts towards WGS major.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-339 </span><span>Birth of Modernism: 1880-1920</span><div>In this course, we will take an interdisciplinary look at the literature and culture of the "transitional" period from Victorianism into Modernism, i.e., 1880-1920.  The course traces the movement in art away from representationalism towards the abstract and the surrealistic, which parallels the movement in literature away from realism towards stream-of-consciousness narrative techniques and symbolist poetry and also explore the period's interest in psychology, primitivism, and decadence. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-341 </span><span>American Gothic</span><div>In this course, we will examine the conjoined roles of sensation and sentiment in American literature from the early national period until the Civil War.  In addition to considering how the gothic challenges assumptions about the primacy and reliability of reason and rationality, we will examine how these texts negotiate issues of identity, race, gender, and sexuality.  We will consider the writings of Alcott, Brown, Freneau, Melville, Poe, and Stoddard, among others. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-342 </span><span>Early 19th Century Fiction in Britain</span><div>An exploration of three writers whose first and anonymously-published novels appeared between 1810 and 1820: Jane Austen, Walter Scott, and Mary Shelley.  Because they initially staked out discrete areas of their fictional works -- domestic life, English and Scottish histories, the findings of modern science -- studying these writers alongside one another should permit students to appreciate the range of concerns that preoccupied British readers of fiction during this period. Each of these novelists was situated to observe important institutions from within: Scott as a member of the bar, who was also deeply involved in publishing; Austen, with family connections to the church and the navy; and Shelley, who grew up at the intellectual center of English radical thought.  And because two of them had sharply-opposed political stances at a time of national crisis, the course should also help students recognize some of the fault lines that divided those same readers.   Fulfills Humanities requirement</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-343 </span><span>Romantic Poetry and Poetics</span><div>During the romantic period in Britain, poetic culture was strongly influenced by a range of aesthetic concepts, often the focus of vigorous debate, that affected both the composition and reception of much of the writing of the period.  Among the concerns taken up by the writers of the period are attempts to define sublimity and beauty, the possibility of writing in an organic form in keeping with spontaneity of expression, the prizing of gusto, the aspiration to reconcile competing desires and aims, the effort to use figurative language as a means of exploration and revelation, the recovery of “the real language of men” for artistic purposes, the naming (through “romantic irony”) of the gap between the real and the ideal.  Readings include an extensive sampling of poems from this period, important statements about the nature of poetry by several of these writers themselves, salient reviews of their work, aesthetic retrospective statements from later in the nineteenth century about the tenor of romantic writing.  Poets on the syllabus will include Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake, Keats, Percy Shelley, Smith, Robinson, and Hemans.  Fulfills Humanities requirement.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-344 </span><span>Victorians Abroad</span><div>This course will explore the complex relationship between British Victorians – poets, novelists, explorers, adventurers – and the larger world.  The nineteenth century witnessed the beginnings of what we now call globalization.  The British Empire stretched around the globe, and for the first time, the “common people” (rather than simply the military and merchant class) were able to travel far beyond the British Isles.  From the Brownings’ and Ruskin’s love affairs with Italy, to Darwin’s voyages to the South Pacific, to Joseph Conrad’s fictional journey into Africa, Victorians explored the world at large in unprecedented numbers.  This course will explore the accounts, in poetry and prose, both fictional and actual, of these explorations.  Authors may include John Ruskin, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, Charles Dickens, Charles Darwin, Anna Leonowens, Joseph Conrad, Rudyard Kipling, Richard Francis Burton, Mary Kingsley, and Isabella Bird. Fulfills Humanities requirement .</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-345 </span><span>Second Generation Romantics</span><div>A study of the poetry, and their writing about poetry, of Byron, Shelley, and Keats, particularly as a response to the conservative turn of the best known and most influential poets of their world. Alongside them we will look at representative novelists—Scott and Austen—whose sympathies inclined more toward a tradition their poetic contemporaries tended to resist.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-346 </span><span>Early Romantics:  Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Contemporaries</span><div>A study of the way in which Romanticism became a dominant presence in British culture during the last decade of the eighteenth century and in first years of the nineteenth.  We will concentrate on the generation of writers -- most familiarly Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge -- who established themselves during these years, and who were united by a desire to create a new poetic idiom, grounded in the claims they could make for imagination, less conventionalized and perhaps less formal than that which they saw as dominating British culture.  Crucial contexts to explore will be their differing responses to problems posed by Enlightenment thought, the French Revolution, the subsequent outbreak of war, the industrial revolution, the rise of modern science, and the dominance of English politics by Tory ministries.  Writers to be introduced, in addition to those already mentioned, may include such figures as Charlotte Turner Smith, Mary Darby Robinson, Walter Scott, and William Godwin.   Fulfills Humanities requirement</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-348 </span><span>The Victorian Novel</span><div>Between 1837 (when Victoria was crowned) and 1901 (when she passed away), approximately 60,000 novels were written and published in England.  If the eighteenth century witnessed the birth of the novel as a legitimate literary genre, and the twentieth century has seen its dissolution, then the nineteenth century must be seen as the novel's heyday.  Because most of the novels written during this period were "triple-deckers," long three-volume novels, it is impossible to study more than a few in a single semester.  But even our short list of six works shows the variety of presentation possible within the limits of the term "novel."</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-349 </span><span>The Brontës</span><div>Audiences were divided between rapture and revulsion when three previously unknown sisters—Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë—began to publish wildly popular novels in mid-nineteenth-century Britain. Ever since, their works have remained current through a constant stream of (re)adaptations. How have the Brontë sisters stayed so popular? How did these young women engage with the social problems of their era? Alongside a selection of novels, we will read a variety of poems, childhood writings, and reviews.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-350 </span><span>Topics in 20th &amp; 21st Century Literature</span><div>Advanced study of a variety of authors, themes, genres, and movements during the 20th and/or early 21st centuries.  Courses may cover American, British, transnational, and/or post-colonial literatures.  Fulfills Humanities requirement</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-352 </span><span>Contemporary American Fiction</span><div>Course studies form, content, and diversity in American fiction since the 1940s, drawing on a selection of novels and short stories by such writers as Updike, Nabokov, Carver, Bellow, Pynchon, and others. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-353 </span><span>Fitzgerald Hemingway &amp; Circle</span><div>Intensive study of the writings of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Earnest Hemingway, especially during their salad days in the 1920s, with a look at some other contemporary writers who influenced them or were associated with them. Course examines the nature of Fitzgerald and Hemingway's imaginations, the development and characteristics of their distinctive fictional voices, and the causes of their declining powers in the 1930s. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-354 </span><span>Wharton, Dreiser, Cather</span><div>A study of three early twentieth-century American novelists: Edith Wharton, the cultivated member of high society in old New York; Theodore Dreiser, the relentlessly unsentimental journalist from Indiana; and Willa Cather, the nostalgic Nebraskan.  We will read two or three novels by each writer, focusing on each novel individually, to place it in its biographical, geographical, literary and cultural context; but also stepping back to look at the three writers in relation to one another, looking for both connections and diverging outlooks among them.  We will also look at critical works and some primary documents, such as correspondence and memoirs.  Among the novels to be read will be The House of Mirth, Ethan Frome, The Age of Innocence, Sister Carrie, Jennie Gerhardt, My Ántonia, and Death Comes for the Archbishop. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-355 </span><span>Radical American Women</span><div>This course will look at the ways in which women writers in the U.S. have experimented with and invented new literary forms in their respective engagements with personal identity, starting with Emily Dickinson and running through the 21st century. Writers under analysis may include H.D., Gertrude Stein, Mina Loy, Marianne Moore, Elizabeth Bishop, Adrienne Rich, Joan Didion, Mary McCarthy, Theresa Haak Kyung Cha, Susan Howe, Lyn Hejinian, Haryette Mullen, Mónica de la Torre, and Myung Mi Kim. The course will include field trips and author visits.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-356 </span><span>The Beats and Beyond</span><div>Students begin by examining the work of key figures in the beat movement. Our focus here will be on the autobiographical imperatives behind the work of these writers; specifically, they sought to make their everyday lives the bases of their literary art. Our next concern will be with extensions of the beat impulse beyond the 1950s. In the 1960s certain comically inclined writers continued the linguistic innovations of the beats yet at the same time began to scrutinize beat efforts to construct an alternative identity. Specifically, we will look critically at the "primitivist" impulses informing the desire to become a "White Indian." We will then read works that emerged out of the more politically explosive 1960s as the hipster gave way to the hippie. Throughout this course we will be making reference to adjacent developments and innovations in the field of avant-garde or underground film practice. In addition we will investigate the decline of utopian aspirations in the 70s in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Among the writers included are Burroughs, Kerouac, Ginsberg, Snyder, Pynchon, Percy, Doctorow, Acosta, Berger, Kesey, Barth, Didion, Brautigan, and Southern. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-358 </span><span>Contemporary Women Writers</span><div>At the end of A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf foresees the coming of a new generation of women writers.  It is now over 70 years since Woolf wrote her manifesto.  Since then, many women have written many books.  Perhaps now it is time to explore the new directions taken by modern women writers.  How have they used their new "habit of freedom"?  Are they writing exactly what they think?  What are they writing about? What innovations have they made on literary tradition? What shapes do their imaginative visions take? How have they revised literary history? In this course, student will read such contemporary women writers as Julie Alvarez, Margaret Atwood, A.S. Byatt, Angela Carter, Maryse Conde, Allegra Goodman, Bharati Mukherjee, Jewell Parker Rhodes, and Jeanette Winterson.  During the second half of the semester, we will read and discuss writers selected by the students. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-359 </span><span>British Writers 1918-1939</span><div>A study of the literature of the two decades between the two great European wars of the first half of the 20th century, including poetry, fiction and non-fiction. Writers to be studies include Eliot, Yeats, Auden, Woolf, Waugh and Greene. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-361 </span><span>The Worlds of William Faulkner</span><div>This course will undertake an in-depth study of William Faulkner’s major works of fiction and their impact on -- and place within -- literary Modernism. We will begin by looking at some of Faulkner’s early influences, such as Sherwood Anderson, and then trace the arc of Faulkner’s major novels and stories, considering both their experimental and their more conventional aspects, particularly in light of the literary movements and artistic developments surrounding him and the reception of his work throughout the twentieth-century. Of particular concern will be Faulkner’s invented Yoknawpatapha County in Mississippi, his various methods of narration, and his interest in "truth," all in an effort to explore what he meant when he stated, "I don’t care much for facts, am not much interested in them, you can’t stand a fact up, you’ve got to prop it up, and when you move to one side a little and look at it from that angle, it’s not thick enough to cast a shadow in that direction." At the end of the semester, we will discuss Faulkner’s film work in Hollywood. Finally, we will begin to consider his legacy as it is expressed in more recent cultural production, particularly in literature of the Global South by writers such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-362 </span><span>LGBTQ African American Literature</span><div>This course explores the prominence of LGBTQ identities and narratives within African American literary and cultural traditions. Through a purposefully multi-genre exploration of African American literature, spanning from the Harlem Renaissance to the contemporary moment, we will focus on writers who identify as part of the LGBTQ community, as well as those artists who prominently feature LGBTQ subjects and figures within their work.  While examining the intersections of race, sexuality, and gender in creative expression, we will also engage the broader social, political, and cultural implications of these works, considering themes of marginalization, identity formation and articulation, social justice, and activism.  Fulfills Humanities and Conceptualizing Diversity requirements.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-363 </span><span>The Other America: Transnational and Hemispheric American Studies</span><div>Students in this course will examine U.S., Caribbean, and Latin American literature in a comparative and interdisciplinary context. Beginning in the late-nineteenth century and moving through more contemporary voices, we will read novels, poems, and critical works that address the historical and cultural relationship between the American North and South, i.e., between global geographies that
have been divided into core and peripheral zones. The concept of the 'Western hemisphere' gained cohesion through the displacement and erasure of indigenous populations across the global South.  We will therefore assess how the recovery of knowledge, history, and freedom remains central to literary works that mobilize a hemispheric imagination. Students will explore how imperialism, racialism, polyculturalism, and multilingualism not only shaped cultural production in the Americas but also provided a shared experience of loss and fragmentation that becomes the object of modernist representation across national divides. Moreover, students will examine the literary devices and narrative structures that constitute cross-regional anxieties concerning historical origins, geography, chronology, and memory across the continent. In addition to primary texts, we will engage criticism
across the fields of Atlantic, borderlands, and diaspora studies to identify and understand key concepts that span the fraught yet emerging field of transnational American literature.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-364 </span><span>Afrofuturism</span><div>Afrofuturism is an artistic and critical movement concerned with the place of science fiction and technology in black culture.  This interdisciplinary course investigates the origins and influences of African/ African American contributions to science fiction in the forms of literature, comic book arts, film, music, performance, and visual culture.  Beginning by highlighting the historical roots of Afrofuturism in African American speculative fiction dating back to the nineteenth century, this course then focuses on the different ways African/ African American artists and thinkers have used science fiction to critique contemporary forms of racial difference and imagine alternate futures.  Additional topics of discussion will include Afro-pessimism, Afro-optimism, utopia, futurity, blackness, and metaphysics.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-365 </span><span>Magical Realism Across Continents</span><div>This course explores magical realism as an international literary artform that combines supernatural phenomena with realistic representations of everyday life. This fusion of fact and fantasy originated by questioning not only the nature of reality but also the possibility of creating new realities amid historic struggles for national autonomy in the global South. As such, magical realism can be understood as a literary expression of postcolonial thought that adopts yet transforms Western modernism to assert the innovation, authority, and importance of non-Western modernisms. The first one-third of the course will cover the foundations of magical realism as a set of Latin American modes and worldviews. As such, it will feature readings by Alejo Carpentier, Gabriel Garcia Márquez, Julio Cortázar, and Jorge Luis Borges. Other parts of the course will trace the expansion and propagation of magical realism across other geographies and identities around the world. In these sections, we will read texts by Toni Morrison, Louise Erdrich, Moshid Hamin, Ben Okri, and Jeanette Winterson—from Native American and African American authors in the US to authors in Pakistan, Nigeria, and England. Students will have an opportunity to bring these texts, together with secondary sources, into comparative dialogue with films such as Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s Labryinth and Issa López’s Tigers Are Not Afraid, among others, to note the cross-cultural connections between magical realism and expressions of loss, trauma, resistance, and renewal. As we encounter these works, we will explore questions such as: What are the literary strategies and narrative techniques used to naturalize the supernatural? How has this mode changed in moving from Latin American contexts to other cultures around the world? What myths and oral traditions influence what some critics have called the “ontological foundations” of magical realism, and what forms of irreverence and metafiction inform the more “epistemological foundations” of the mode?</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-366 </span><span>Human Rights and Literature</span><div>While the paradigm of human rights declares a commitment to equality and universal access to basic freedoms, its development and impact in the world has been uneven and contradictory. In fact, the discourse of the human emerges precisely because a declaration of universal rights failed to emerge consistently across racial and legal lines after the French and American revolutions. Thinkers like Hannah Arendt, Giorgio Agamben, and Joseph Slaughter have shown that human rights as a field has often been marked by a structural interdependence on the state, the corporation, or, indeed, the market. This course asks how literary representations of human rights in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries raise important questions about empathy, violence, torture, citizenship, and security. By blending literature with political theory, the course explores key human rights figures such as the migrant, the detainee, the refugee, and the undocumented through novels, short stories, and graphic novels from Kashmir, Palestine, Sri Lanka, Botswana, Guantánamo and the US, and Australia’s Manus Island.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-367 </span><span>James Baldwin in Fiction and Essays</span><div>Over the course of the semester, we will explore the literary output of one of the 20th Century’s most prolific writers, James Baldwin.  Students will have the opportunity to deeply engage and critically reflect on Baldwin’s fiction, essays, and poetry.  Moreover, Baldwin’s writing will serve as the foundation for our exploration of themes of race, class, gender, and sexuality that continue to make his work as relevant in the contemporary moment as when they were first published.  Fulfills Humanities and Conceptualizing Diversity requirements.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-378 </span><span>Autobiography in African American Narrative</span><div>This course will examine the role of autobiography in African American literary and historical narratives during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, considering autobiography, memoir, autobiographical fiction, and fictional narratives that are written in an autobiographical style.  Understanding that autobiography offers personal reflection on lived experiences, we will broaden our scope to consider how African American writers create narratives that center around personal experience yet speak to the shared reality of their community.  Fulfills Humanities and Conceptualizing Diversity requirements.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-382 </span><span>Civil War in American Imagination</span><div>Students will examine literary interpretations of the American Civil War, with particular emphasis on nineteenth-century representations.  Not only a critical political and social event, the Civil War also provided a flexible reference to postbellum thinkers and writers; students will explore the different ways in which figurations of the War and the myths it spawned were manipulated to endorse or critique various political, social, economic, and racial practices.  Fulfills Humanities requirement</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-383 </span><span>Truth and the American Way</span><div>This course will examine the problems and parameters of truth in the American literary traditions of realism and naturalism.  While considering the sundry implications of a fictional practice that defines itself according to standards of accuracy and truthfulness, we will also explore the ways in which such a program challenges basic assumptions about the purpose of literature, the limits of fiction, and the nature of reality.  Although the focus of the course will be on nineteenth-century American literature, we will also consider the ways in which the evolution of photography, the development of various academic disciplines (like, for example, psychology or anthropology), and changing information technologies impacted the definitions of truth, of reality, and of fiction.  The reading list will include works by Dreiser, Howells, Wharton, Norris, Chesnutt, James, and Twain. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-386 </span><span>Rethinking Race &amp; Nation</span><div>This course examines the complex relationship between writers of color and America, emphasizing concepts such as patriotism, racial and ethnic marginalization, social critique, nationalism, and diasporan identity. Centering literature—to include fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and lyric—in debates over slavery, immigration, imperialism, civil rights, and citizenship across the arc of American history, this course maintains a particular emphasis on social justice movements as inspiration and context for literary production, but also as key moments for critical exploration of American identity.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-391 </span><span>Feminine/Feminist Aesthetics</span><div>Students will explore questions of difference.  Do women and men write differently? Do women and men read differently? Do men and women represent themselves and each other differently?  According to Cynthia Ozick, the answer is no: "When we write we are not women or men but blessed beings in possession of a Promethean art."  However, many people disagree with her.  According to Whitney Chadwick, "Patriarchal power is structured through men’s control over the power of seeing women." We are all involved in power struggles to name the real.  "It is crucial," writes Felicity Nussbaum, "to open texts to the power struggles that define subjectivities." Students will look at how different subjectivities are constructed and at how they are challenged and subverted.  Readings will include both theoretical texts about aesthetics as well as literary texts. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-392 </span><span>Speculation, American Style</span><div>This course will explore the philosophical impulses, and pretensions, of American literature in the nineteenth century.  Students will read the prose of Emerson, Poe, Thoreau, Melville, Fuller, Douglass, and James in tandem with philosophical and theoretical works by Cavell, Arsic, Agamben, Deleuze, Nussbaum, and others.  It is strongly recommended that students complete a course at the 290 level before enrolling in this class. Offered occasionally.</div><br/></li><li><span>ENG-400 </span><span>Seminar: Special Seminar Themes</span><div>Intensive studies of announced special themed literature.

	Program Requirements 
</h4>
<div>

<h3>The Environmental Studies Major</h3><p>The Environmental Studies major is interdisciplinary with courses that draw from the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Students choose either a Bachelor’s of Arts degree (BA) or a Bachelor’s of Science degree (BS), and pursue an in-depth area of concentration. It is strongly recommended that upon declaring of the ES Major, students develop an ES major plan in consultation with an ES advisor. The plan should include a brief outline of future courses, internships, off-campus study, and independent research. While the plan may change, it encourages students to think intentionally about their academic careers and better prepare them to take full advantage of the learning opportunities available both on and off campus. Graduate schools often require particular coursework for admission, so students considering graduate school should speak with their ES advisors as early as possible.</p><p><strong>Core Curriculum</strong></p><p>Environmental studies majors, both BA and BS, take six core courses. Students typically take ES196 in their first year, and complete the 200-level core courses (211, 223, 225, and 230) by the end of the sophomore year.

    </p>
</div>
</div><p>
	The globalization studies major is both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. Students <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/apply/">must apply</a> to the major and design their own course of study following the guidelines outlined below. Course requirements for the twelve-course major consist of five core courses, three courses in each of two tracks, and a senior capstone project. Globalization Studies majors must also <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/study-abroad/">study abroad</a> or complete some other off-campus program. The requirements are outlined below.

</div><h2>
	Core Requirements (five courses) 
</h2><p>
	Core requirements for the major include four foundation courses and one methods course. Students are encouraged to complete the core requirements by the end of the sophomore year. The purpose of these core courses is to provide a common base of knowledge for all students as well as a basic set of skills and tools with which they can analyze global issues from the perspective of cultures, states, non-state actors, and systems. All five core courses must be taken on campus. Foundation courses, for which majors must earn a grade of C- or better, include the following: 
</p><ul>
<li>Anth 103 Introduction to Cultural Anthropology</li>
<li>Econ 104 Principles of Macroeconomics</li>
<li>GS 225</li>
<li>Pol 103 Introduction to International Relations <i>or</i> Pol 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics</li>
</ul><p>
	No AP credits will be accepted for foundation courses. 
</p><p>
	Students take one course from among the discipline-based methods courses currently offered on campus. Students should take the methods course that best fits with the thematic track they choose for the globalization studies major. This course must be taken before the capstone, and majors must earn a minimum grade of C-. The methods courses students may choose from include, but are not limited to: 
</p><ul>
<li>ANTH 323 Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology</li>
<li>ARTH 214 Methods in Art History</li>
<li>CIMS 226 Media and Cultural Theory</li>
<li>ECON 241 Introductory Economics and Business Statistics</li>
<li>ES 230 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems <i>or</i></li>
<li>ES 196 Environmental Science and Society</li>

<li>SOC 302 Research Methods</li>
<li>SPAN 304 Hispanic Linguistics Today</li>
<li>SPAN 305 Intro to Literary/Cultural Studies</li>
<li>WGS 340 Methods</li>
</ul><h2>
	Tracks (six courses) 
</h2><p>
	Students take courses in each of two self-designed tracks. Up to three courses may be taken off campus, and students who study abroad two semesters may apply four off-campus courses to the major, though no single track may contain more than two off-campus courses. 
</p><h3>
	Regional track 
</h3><p>
	The major requires three courses that focus on a single region of the student’s choosing. The purpose of these courses is to ground students in the realities of a particular geographic region's experiences with the processes of globalization. Students can choose to take courses that examine independently and comparatively the history, politics, economics, cultures, literatures, and fine arts of sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Western Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East and North Africa. Students may also define other regions for study, provided that the proposed curriculum and rationale are approved. 
</p><p>
	One of the three courses should focus on some historical aspect of the region in question and one course on some aspect of society and culture in the region. The courses that make up the regional track must draw from at least two disciplines. As part of the process of declaring the globalization studies major, students are asked to provide a rationale for their choice of regional track. The courses for the regional track must be taken at the 200 level and above, with at least one course at the 300 level or higher. Finally, students should complete the College's foreign language requirement in a language appropriate to the region on which they have chosen to focus plus one additional year of language. See language requirements below. 
</p><h3>
	Thematic track 
</h3><p>
	The major requires three courses with a thematic focus. The purpose of these courses is for students to gain in-depth knowledge of some substantive area of globalization studies that combines different disciplines. The courses that make up the thematic track must draw from at least two disciplines. As part of the process of declaring the globalization studies major, students are asked to provide a rationale for their choice of thematic track and must demonstrate a link between their thematic track and methods course. The courses for the thematic track must be taken at the 200 level and above, with at least one course at the 300 level or higher. 
</p><h2>
	Capstone/Senior Seminar 
</h2><p>
	Students take an interdisciplinary capstone seminar, GS 440, during the spring of their senior year. The seminar, offered by faculty teaching in the globalization studies program, requires students to conduct research on some challenge currently facing the global system. Majors must earn a minimum grade of C-. Students must complete the methods course and off-campus study before enrolling in the capstone. 
</p><p>
	GS 440: An intensive seminar experience in which students in the final semester of their GS major will have an opportunity to interact, learn, and bond as a cohort. The capstone will meet once a week for 2.5 hours, during which time students will undertake a common core of coursework related to Globalization as an interdisciplinary field of study. A major objective of the capstone is the completion of an individual capstone project or thesis which reflects a synthesis of the student's regional studies, thematic tracks, study abroad experience, and capstone-related independent research. Students are expected to present their work in a public forum. 
</p><h2>
	Study Abroad or other off-campus study 
</h2><p>
	Globalization Studies majors are required to spend at least one semester <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/study-abroad/">studying abroad</a> or participating in some other off-campus program, such as the Washington, D.C., semester programs offered through American University and Lutheran College.  Students should select a program that complements the Regional Track of their major. 
</p><h2>
	Language requirements for GS Majors 
</h2><p>
	All GS majors graduating in 2014 or later must also take four foreign language courses. The first two courses are required to meet the college's language requirement. The next two courses can be in the same language or in one or two additional language(s). These can be taken on campus or off campus. Half-credit language courses, such as those offered by SIT in less-commonly taught languages, will count. Languages should be appropriate to the regional track. 
</p><h2>
	For those planning to Double Major 
</h2><p>
	Students who declare a major in addition to the globalization studies major may count up to three courses from their other major toward the requirements for the globalization studies major.

</div><h2>Brief Overview</h2><p>The individualized major exemplifies the hallmarks of a liberal arts education at Gettysburg College. Individualized majors are integrated, interdisciplinary, self-designed majors that combine coursework and other experiences from at least two departments or fields with other experiences such as internships and off-campus study.</p><p>Students who complete an individualized major make connections across courses and achieve an education that is more than a transcript of self-contained courses. In addition, they are self-reflective and able to write and think in ways that express a growing self-awareness about the progress and impact of their education. The individualized major program is for students who want to chart a truly original path through the Gettysburg Curriculum by designing their own course of study.</p><h2>How to Apply</h2><p>To create an individualized major, you must develop a concept that is focused on a problem, question, or area of investigation of special interest, and that cannot be adequately addressed within a single department or discipline, or by an existing major at the college. You must <a href="/academic-programs/interdisciplinary-studies/programs/individualized-major/forms">submit an application</a> to the Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) Committee explaining your concept and proposing the courses through which you will explore it. Faculty sponsors (from two separate departments) will work with you to help you polish your application and will advise and guide you through your course of study.</p><p>Your individualized major must be an integrated plan of study that incorporates coursework from a minimum of two departments or fields. In addition, an individualized major includes:</p><ul>
<li>twelve courses, no more than two of which may be at the 100-level;</li>
<li>three or more courses at the 300-level or above;</li>
<li>a designated Methods course;</li>
<li>a 400-level capstone (IDS 464) taken during the senior year.</li>
</ul><p>After consulting with a member of the IDS Committee and meeting several times with two prospective faculty advisors, students should submit their applications to the IDS Committee for review. All applications for individualized major must be<strong> approved by the end of the second year. No new applications for an individualized major will be considered from students in their junior or senior year.</strong></p><p>Students must have a 2.5 overall GPA to be accepted into the program. Students should be aware that an individualized major may require departmental methods or theory courses and additional advanced coursework particular to each of the fields within the program. In addition, it is often possible to build a significant internship or component of off-campus study into your major.</p><h2>Once you are accepted</h2><p>If you need to make changes in the course list after the IDS Committee has approved your individualized major, you must submit a “Course Change Request Form” to the IDS Committee. This form must be signed electronically by both faculty advisors, indicating their approval. Students may change up to three courses from their originally approved individualized major. If a student needs to change more than three courses, then they must submit a new individualized major application that explains and justifies the new course of study. <strong>Note that students may not request a course change for a course that has already been completed.</strong> Furthermore, students must pass all courses approved for their major.</p><p>Students must earn a minimum grade of C in their designated Methods course and they may only retake their designated Methods course one time.

	Courses 
</h4>
<div>

<li><span>IDS-104 </span><span>Literary Foundations of Western Culture</span><div>Exploration of the development of major genres of Western literature and thought (from the fall of the Roman Empire to the 18th century), including epic and narrative poetry, drama, the novel, and literary nonfiction.  Authors read may include St. Augustine, Dante, Rabelais, Shakespeare, Milton, Voltaire, and others.  Through reading, writing, and discussion of complete works, the student is introduced to those humanistic skills and critical methods that have traditionally distinguished the liberally education person. Course not offered every year.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-121 </span><span>Introduction to Peace and Justice Studies</span><div>Multidisciplinary survey of issues, concepts, and approaches to peace and justice at individual, social, and cultural levels.  Topics include models of peace, the nature and causes of conflict, theory and practice of nonviolence, arms and disarmament, international peace-keeping strategies, and the relationship between peace, human rights, and social justice.  This course may contain a service learning and/or internship component.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-125 </span><span>The Love of Wisdom and the Wisdom of Love</span><div>This course will examine the nature of philosophy (‘the love of wisdom’) through a particular question: what is the meaning of love? Love is arguably one of the most basic, most universal, most natural things that human beings do, and yet it is also one of the most complex and paradoxical; and many of our most basic intuitions about love are irreconcilable. We believe that love should be passionate, and yet that it should transcend bodily desires.  We believe that love is the fusion of two incomplete selves, and yet, we also believe that love should be grounded
in one’s own emotional and moral strength. We believe in ‘soul mates,’ while also holding that ‘there are a lot of fish in the sea.’ We believe that love makes us stronger, and that ‘love hurts.’ We see it as both a basic biological impulse, and as a reflection of the divine in humanity. In this course we shall examine the nature of this complex phenomenon through the lenses of religious thought, film, and philosophy.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-150 </span><span>Summer Service Learning</span><div></div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-150 </span><span>Service Learning Project</span><div></div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-206 </span><span>Native American Studies</span><div>Introduction to Native American culture, history, and identity with an interdisciplinary approach and attention to the on-going indigenous struggles since European colonization. Students consider issues of Native perspectives on the people-land relationship, religion, and contemporary cultural expression and politics.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-208 </span><span>Linguistics: Perspectives on Language</span><div>Introduction to linguistics and language pedagogy. The main goal of this course 
is to learn ways of looking at languages to gain perspectives that are necessary in teaching languages as second, foreign, or heritage languages. Students learn about the nature of human language and become familiar with subfields of formal and functional linguistics, first and second language acquisition, bilingualism and heritage languages, and language pedagogy.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-212 </span><span>Postmodern Christian Philosophers</span><div>Course focuses on strains of Christian thought from the 19th and 20th centuries that defy “one size fits all” notions of faith, favoring instead understandings of God that enable concrete engagement in the world. That is to say, for these thinkers, Christianity is an inherently world-oriented way of life, one that is profoundly on the side of the excluded, the marginalized, and the oppressed. It is, simply put, a pluralistic philosophy of spiritual and political liberation. We shall be exploring this thread through various lenses—existentialist theology, weak theology, death of God theology, black liberation theology, feminist Christianity, and process theology, among others.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-214 </span><span>Introduction to Judaism</span><div>Overview of ancient and contemporary Jewish belief and practice through an examination of sacred texts, theology, and history. Special attention is given to Jewish theology, holidays, and life-cycle.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-215 </span><span>Graphic Novels to Film</span><div>Graphic novels and their film adaptations examination. Graphic Novels to Film investigates the linkage between graphic literature, especially in its comic narrative form, and cinema. Through readings and screenings, the course seeks to compare and contrast the storytelling techniques unique to graphic novels with  cinematic language systems.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-216 </span><span>Introduction to War Studies</span><div>This course introduces students to the study of warfare from an interdisciplinary context. Students will approach the subject of war through five distinct perspectives: the philosophy of war; the history of war; the experience of war; war, culture, and society; and the memory of war. The overall goal of the class for students to develop a sophisticated approach to the study of war through an interdisciplinary way of analyzing conflicts both in the past, but also, in our present. By the end of the semester, students will endeavor to answer the following questions: what is war; how does war affect participants/victims; how do societies remember war?</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-217 </span><span>American Civil War on Film</span><div>An examination of how the Civil War has been presented by various  American filmmakers from the silent era to the present.  Students are asked to consider the various themes common to Civil War films:  violence,  race, politics, and iconography, among others.  The class serves as an  introduction to cinematic language systems while using Hollywood images of the Civil War as its central documents for analysis. Course not offered every year.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-218 </span><span>Global Media Cultures</span><div>Consideration of the current state of international media, combining theoretical approaches to globalization with case studies of films, websites and broadcasting systems.  Lecture and discussion is complemented by live interactions (either in person or online via skype) with media producers from across the world.  The course emphasizes the development of students’ abilities to merge theoretical insights with empirical data, allowing class participants to engage in original analyses of specific aspects of the rapidly growing world of international media.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-219 </span><span>Global Media Industries</span><div>Global overview of media industries in the world today.  With a primary focus on cinema and TV, this course interrogates the political economy of the globalized media industries through economic, political, legal, and aesthetic analysis.  Topics include the rise of multimedia, multinational conglomerates, followed by the impact of new technologies creating media convergence, and ending with sections on key global players in Europe and outside of the west.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-220 </span><span>Capitalism vs. Marxism</span><div>This course is an introduction to capitalist &amp; Marxist philosophy, with some emphasis on its underlying philosophical assumptions and arguments. Over the course of the semester we will come to understand how the philosophies of capitalism &amp; Marxism involve philosophical anthropological historical theories that inform our understanding of societies organization and social economic classes. Unfolding from this, the course demands student reflection on the role these two economic philosophies play in the construction of the students’ own socio-econ/philosophical/political orientation. In doing this, the course will also focus on the methodological commitments of the theorists we read.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-221 </span><span>Introduction to Peace and Justice Studies</span><div>Multidisciplinary survey of issues, concepts, and approaches to peace and justice at individual, social, and cultural levels.  Topics include models of peace, the nature and causes of conflict, theory and practice of nonviolence, arms and disarmament, international peace-keeping strategies, and the relationship between peace, human rights, and social justice.  This course may contain a service learning and/or internship component.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-224 </span><span>Justice &amp; the Contested Corporation</span><div>Introduction to continuing debates about purposes and legitimacy of the corporation in American society. Three contrasting conceptions of the modern corporation are critically assessed through justice and historical inquiry. Contested meanings of the corporation are studied using a variety of texts, including fiction, nonfiction, poetry, autobiography, and social criticism. Course is designed as a cluster-friendly opportunity for students to fulfill the Integrative Thinking goal in the Gettysburg Curriculum.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-226 </span><span>Media and Cultural Theory</span><div>Investigation of the major theories that guide the study of media texts and systems.  This course aims to enhance the student’s ability to analyze film, radio, television, the Internet and video games from a perspective that emphasizes the cultural significance of these media.  Through an overview of thinkers from traditions including structuralism, Marxism and British Cultural Studies, students will learn to write about specific texts in a manner that engages deeply with broader traditions of social thought.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-228 </span><span>God Wrestling: Philosophy of Religion</span><div>Explores instrumental Western Philosophers’ discussions of the definitions and characteristics of God, the interrelationship between faith, reason, revelation, the meaning of morality in religious thought and subsequent existential concerns.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-229 </span><span>The Longest Hatred: Antisemitism &amp; Anti-Judaism</span><div>Once considered dormant in the United States, political movements and individual actors espousing antisemitism have made headlines here in the past two years, most notably after the October 27, 2018 shooting attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, which claimed the lives of eleven people. The perpetrator had made Jewhating statements on social media before the attack. (Many of us in Jewish Studies no longer use the word antisemitism, but Jew-hatred. The word ‘anti-Semitism’ was coined by a Jew hating man named Wilhelm Mahr in 29th century Germany. We thus now identify antisemitism for what it is, hatred of Jews.) Globally, some commentators have observed a resurgence of Jew-hatred over the past two decades. Attempts by policy-makers and activists to identify and combat Jew-hatred, whether on the streets of urban centers, across social media spaces, or in college dormitories, are often hobbled by a lack of knowledge about the history of the phenomenon. Academic scholarship, on the other hand, sometimes suffers from a lack of attention to its contemporary manifestations.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-231 </span><span>Nineteenth Century Jewish Thought</span><div>Explores the ways in which G.W.F. Hegel’s philosophy of history informs Jewish philosophy in the nineteenth century. Hegel’s view – that history unfolds meaningfully and that it tends toward the ends of freedom and justice – is in tension with the increasing hostility of intensifying antisemitism in 19th century Europe, provoking a variety of responses on the part of Jewish thinkers as to the future of Jewish life and Judaism’s place in Western culture. This arc, coupled with the infamous “Dreyfus Affair” in Paris, gave rise to the Zionist movement, which would ultimately lead to the formation of the Jewish state of Israel in the mid-20th century. Figures to be discussed in this class are Moses Hess, Hermann Cohen, Karl Marx, and Theodor Herzl.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-236 </span><span>Literature, Language, and Life</span><div>Literature, Language, and Life explores the unique ways in which literature enables human beings to make meaning – philosophical, religious, cultural, etc. – out of their lives. It does so through three distinct pedagogical avenues: (1) works of philosophy and literary criticism dedicated to the question of the meaning of literature itself; (2) readings of key novels from the last three centuries; (3) writings in the areas of philosophy, religion, and psychoanalysis, that are either contextually important background texts for the works in question, or works of analysis on said fiction works.  In addition, the course will address some of the major characteristics of the dominant artistic and cultural periods, such as Romanticism, Surrealism, Modernism, Postmodernism, and Metamodernism.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-237 </span><span>Postmodern Jewish Philosophy</span><div>An exploration of how 20th century Jewish thinkers critically address many of the religious, spiritual, existential, social and ethical issues that face contemporary, Western society. Their insights are used to help us understand the world in which we live. Discussion is an important part of this course.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-238 </span><span>Religion &amp; Politics in the Middle East</span><div>Religion and Politics in the Middle East is a course designed to introduce students to the variety of ways that Muslims, Christians and Jews in the contemporary Middle East have struggled to define their religious traditions and national aspirations in light of the changes brought about by modernity. The course will specifically look at the role of religion in the political sphere of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-241 </span><span>Modern Irish Drama</span><div>Exploration of the evolution of modern Irish theatre within the matrix of the esthetic and political revolutions that occurred, and continue to occur, in twentieth-century Ireland.  Irish dramatists have produced a body of literature remarkable for both its unparalleled artistic achievement and its acute political and social responsiveness.  Major emphasis is accorded W. B. Yeats, Lady Augusta Gregory, John M. Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett, and Brian Friel. Course not offered every year.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-243 </span><span>Protest Music &amp; Social Change in the American Experience</span><div>The famous inscription Woody Guthrie placed on his guitar in 1943 says something profound about how many artists and musicians view their work: while art entertains us, it also can enlighten and liberate us as well. Unfortunately, the history of America often taught in schools focuses largely on names, dates, and other facts pieced together in an effort to tell a particular kind of story about America—one that does little to help us appreciate the struggle that runs like a swift current just beneath the surface of daily life. In this hybrid/online seminar we will revisit some of that history, focusing specifically on the way musical artists have attempted to right wrongs, educate sensibilities, and awaken the consciences of people in an effort to make America a place that lives up to its promise.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-247 </span><span>Modern Irish Literature</span><div>Survey of Irish literature since the 1940s. Course examines how poets, dramatists, and writers of fiction have responded to the problems of maintaining an Irish identity on a partitioned island and in the contemporary world. Special attention is given to the interrelationship of Catholic and Protestant and rural and urban traditions. Authors studied include dramatists such as Samuel Beckett, poets such as Seamus Heaney, and fiction writers such as Sean O'Faolain. Not offered every year.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-250 </span><span>Topics in Interdisciplinary Studies</span><div>Interdisciplinary analysis of one subject, topic, or discipline as viewed through distinct disciplinary methodologies or through the methods and inquiries of one discipline as viewed through the lens of another discipline. Course not offered every year.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-252 </span><span>Youth and New Media in the Middle East</span><div>This course will introduce the numerous ways in which Arab youth charted an alternative path towards social and political change in the Middle East through the use of new media and modern technologies. Discussions focus on the challenges Arab youth face in their 21st-century, globalized environments, and on their engagement with their regimes and societies, particularly in the context of the Arab Spring. Arab youth’s artistic and political expressions are discussed as a primary aspect for the transformation in the region. This course will place engagement in new media platforms within the broader context of the Arab media landscape and its history, as well as examine the socially constructed category of “youth" within a regional and historical context. Additionally, contemporary cultural and political events in the Arab world will be frequent sources of discussion. Readings for this course will be drawn from a variety of fields of scholarship, including sociology, anthropology, and media studies, among others.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-255 </span><span>Science,Technology &amp; Nuclear Weapons</span><div>Study of the effect of technology on the many issues related to nuclear weapons and the scientific principles associated with their production.  Coverage includes nuclear weapons effects, strategic arsenals, past and current attempts at arms control, environmental impact of weapons production, testing and dismantlement the post cold war climate, and nuclear disarmament.  Special emphasis is given toward understanding current nuclear non-proliferation efforts.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-265 </span><span>Jewish Thought and the Enlightenment</span><div>Explores the role of Enlightenment thinking in the context of Jewish intellectual history. While the Enlightenment marked a genuine revolution that affected every corner of the Western world, its radical impact is all the greater against the backdrop of Jewish intellectual life, as the cultural and intellectual space of Judaism itself within the history of the West has always been precarious and ill-defined. As a result, the collisions and renegotiations between Enlightenment thinking and Jewish thinking provide rich and fertile soil for intellectual exploration and innovations. This course will look at some of the key writings of Jewish thinkers who grappled with the implications of Enlightenment thinking, and who left a lasting impact on Jewish and Christian thinking, and on Western thought more broadly, exploring questions concerning the relation between revelation and reason, religion and the state, humanity, nature, and God.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-270 </span><span>Marx, Darwin, Nietzsche, Freud: Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</span><div>In the span of a single century, and from completely different areas of study, these
four thinkers completely revolutionized the way that human beings understand themselves and their place in the cosmos. Displacing the Enlightenment notion of the self-interested, rational agent who reflects the image of God with an innate sense of the Good, these thinkers tore back the veils of all of our most cherished idols – God, language, justice, morality, rationality, market forces, and cosmic 
order. Their works not only overturned millennia of cultural assumptions; they prophesied the horrors of the 20th century, and established the framework of critical suspicion thatinforms much of humanistic study to this day.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-278 </span><span>Introduction to Arab Culture</span><div>This course will offer a general mosaic survey of the linguistic, geographical, historical, social, religious, cultural, and artistic aspects of the modern Arab world. Special attention will be given to the education, politics, family, gender relations, the Arab experience in the U.S., Arab American relations, the role of the past and of social change, and Arab art and music. The course also,  analyzes and discusses Arab Spring and modern post-colonial concerns, problems and challenges. A good deal of the course is specifically intended to increase students' sensitivity to racial bias and sharpen awareness of multicultural issues.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-280 </span><span>Media and the Arab World</span><div>Study of the broad thematic and linguistic content of the media of the contemporary Middle East, especially news media and the new social media. The course examines contemporary social and political issues through an historical and cultural lens, focusing on such themes as dissent and revolutionary resistance, globalization and Arab mass media, media culture and political discourse, gender and national identity, media and social life, and youth culture, Facebook and the blogosphere.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-282 </span><span>Language and Conflict in the Middle East</span><div>Examination of the interrelationship of linguistics, culture and politics with emphasis on the interpretation of conflict. Readings examine how differences in pronunciation, vocabulary choice, non-verbal communication, and communicative style serve as social markers of identity and differentiation in Arab cultures. Emphasis is given to discourse analysis of news media, political speeches, regime and opposition media, blogs and Facebook communities, and virtual political dialogue.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-284 </span><span>Wonders of Nature and Artifice: The Renaissance Quest for Knowledge</span><div>Examination of Renaissance collections and the social context of their development.  The course explores the quest for knowledge by Renaissance naturalists and collectors, whose wonders of nature and artifice were displayed in curiosity cabinets, gardens, and writings. The interaction of art and science and the role of economics, politics and culture are explored.  Students engage in hands-on work, analyzing a Renaissance chamber of wonders at the Walters Art Museum and putting together their own "cabinet" in the Schmucker Art Gallery.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-285 </span><span>Interpreting and Preserving Museum Artifacts</span><div>Museums are repositories of the various facets of human experience. This course will examine the history of museums, the philosophy behind the human practice of collecting objects of all types (including art, history, natural history, archaeology, and ethnography), the methods used to understand the significance of objects and collections, the techniques used to bring them to light in the exhibit environment, and the principles and practices that ensure their longevity for future visitors and scholars.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-305 </span><span>Power, Punishment, and Pleasure: Michel Foucault</span><div>Explores some of the major works of 20th century French thinker and cultural critic, Michel Foucault. Few thinkers of the 20th century had a greater or more lasting impact than Foucault. Giving a new meaning to the adage, ‘knowledge is power,’ Foucault’s work challenges accepted orthodoxies regarding the concept of ‘truth’ by examining fundamental questions of power and knowledge, demonstrating the ways in which they are intertwined, as well as how that ‘knowledge’ shapes our understanding of ourselves. Fueled by the turmoil of the 1960s, Foucault’s writing crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries, leaving an indelible mark in areas as diverse as philosophy of education, history, literary theory, sociology, aesthetics, health studies, epistemology, gender and sexuality studies, and prison reform.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-306 </span><span>Sympathy for the Devil</span><div>Course will explore the figure of the Devil through various historical, religious, philosophical, literary, and cinematic lenses. He is known by a number of different names: Lucifer, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles, Satan, Prince of Darkness, Prince of this World, or Lord of the Flies; but all of these are proper names and titles for that elusive figure most prominently known as the embodiment of pure evil and rebellion in Christianity. Despite the fact that very little is said about this figure in the Bible, the Devil has, throughout history, served as an abstract canvas onto which human beings have projected their greatest fears and adversarial forces, be they political, natural, epidemiological, religious, or moral. As a result, an entire mythos has grown around this elusive figure, complete with the allure and romance that accompanies characters associated with rebellion and transgression.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-307 </span><span>Violence and Revolution: A Theoretical Look</span><div>Theoretical analysis of the reasons for which revolutionary violence may or may not be justifiable, and the conditions that would make it so. It explores through a textual-historical lens the basic nature and purpose of the modern nation-state, and with it the nature of violence—in the forms that the state itself implements, in the forms that the state’s organization fosters in its citizens, and in the forms that revolutionary forces bring (and have brought) in opposition to the state.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-308 </span><span>Neoliberalism and its Demons</span><div>Explores the economic-theoretical developments that have taken place in the Western world since the Great Depression, as well as the ethical and philosophical considerations that those developments entail. The three central tenets of neoliberal ideology are: (1) Deregulation; (2) Privatization; and (3) Free Trade. But as a holistic vision of the world, neoliberalism entails the commodification of every facet of our lives. Issues to be discussed in the course include: the relation between the state and the individual, the connections between social and economic conservatism, the responses (or lack thereof) to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, globalization and its impacts, immigration and racism, “fake news”, and the extent to which economic encroachment may impede the egalitarian aims of democracy.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-315 </span><span>The Muse of Fire: War Stories and Culture</span><div>This is a course on war stories. It is based on a simple concept: that war has long been a muse for writers, artists, and filmmakers and that representations of war have a lasting cultural legacy. War stories profoundly influence our understanding of violence. They create myths – important social and political narratives on the past – that help us understand and justify violence in history. In this course, students will read a broad sampling of war literature and study thematically corresponding war films to learn how to conceptualize and contextualize war stories. More broadly, students will also learn how war stories are constructed as sources of memory and how they, in turn, become powerful memorial expressions for veterans, ones that influence the way that societies interpret violence over time.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-320 </span><span>Aftermath: The Experience of War and ‘Modern’ Memory</span><div>This is a course that will examine, primarily, two conflicts in modern history and their lasting representations in cultural history and literary memory.  Wars have long cultural legacies.  Both the American Civil War and First World War changed not only the ‘war generation’ of each conflict, but also, demonstrate case studies of the representation of war and the polemics of memory within nation states.  In this class students will engage with the cultural and military histories of two different conflicts and compare their lasting impact in our contemporary perception of war and society. As such, the ‘experience of war’ will be our broad topic of consideration.  We will access this theme by examining memory sources that detail and represent these experiences over time.  The class’s methodological themes will address the following: conceptions of victory and defeat, the memory of participants and their representations of war, the writing of history and the mythologies created by conflicts and their chroniclers. By studying the cultural history of combat and its aftermath, students will learn something about the way history is written and historical events depicted over time. Through interdisciplinary representations of war in film and literature, it is hoped that students will gain an understanding of the changing perceptions of wars, within the conception of modern memory.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-325 </span><span>Interdisciplinary Course in London</span><div>An interdisciplinary course taught in London by a Gettysburg College faculty member during the one-month presession to the Gettysburg in England program.  Topics will vary.  The topic during the fall of 2010 will be Global Cities.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-331 </span><span>Religion and Technology</span><div>This course explores modern Jewish thinkers who critically address how technology has changed Western attitudes concerning religion, ethics and community. In addition, we will use the readings as springboards to discuss such issues as alienation, labor, abortion, cloning and more. The insights of these thinkers will help us better understand the world in which we live. An exploration of how modern Jewish thinkers critically address the question of technology and its effect on Western attitudes concerning religion, ethics and community. The course uses the readings as springboards to discuss such issues as alienation, labor, abortion, cloning and more. The insights of these thinkers help to better understand the world in which we live.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-338 </span><span>Ethics after the Holocaust</span><div>An exploration of Jewish responses to the holocaust, looking at Jewish religious, literary, ethical, and philosophical responses to the Holocaust. The theme of the course will be how the Holocaust threatens traditional understandings of Judaism, and monotheism, social ethics, spirituality, and community.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-339 </span><span>Media and Memory After the Holocaust</span><div>Study of the representations of Holocaust memory across a range of media. The selections for “Media and Memory After the Holocaust” explore how aesthetics and media shape testimony. By examining memory and the means of its making—in film, literature, oral recordings, comics, holography, and more—this class places emphasis on the philosophical and ethical dimensions of documenting the Holocaust. Field trips to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum as well as class visits from scholars and artists complement the course offerings.  CIMS 339 and IDS 339 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>IDS-350 </span><span>Topics in Interdisciplinary Studies</span><div>Interdisciplinary analysis of one subject, topic, or discipline as viewed through distinct disciplinary methodologies or through the methods and inquiries of one discipline as viewed through the lens of another discipline.

You come to learn that language involves not only vocabulary in the crafting of expression but also syntax and idiom, and that cultural idiosyncrasies permeate any language, including your own.</span></p><p><span>As an Italian Studies major or minor, you’ll have access to:</span></p><ul>
<li><span>Beginning and intermediate language learning</span></li>
<li><span>Courses in Italian cinema and culture taught in English</span></li>

<li><span>Exposure to Italian film, websites, contemporary events, music, and lifestyle</span></li>
<li><span>At all levels of Italian study, you’ll have the opportunity to study abroad in Ferrara, Italy, completing your language requirement in one semester. You’ll have a true immersion experience, taking all courses in Italian.</span></li>

<p>Gettysburg College’s Department of Classics offers a minor in Latin. Studying ancient languages helps us to understand our own language more clearly and to express ourselves in English with greater precision and persuasive power. Classical literature not only offers the opportunity to examine Greek and Roman cultures through the observations and sentiments of their own writers but may also confront us with such issues as political realism and ethical idealism on a public level and love and death on a personal one.</p><p><b>Latin Minor</b><br/>Any six courses in Latin (LAT) at any level; OR any five courses in Latin (LAT) at any level, plus one course in Classics (CLA) at any level.</p></div>

<p>
	For students enrolled at Gettysburg College prior to Fall 2019 
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The Department of Management offers a major in <strong>Organization and Management Studies (OMS)</strong> for students enrolled at Gettysburg College prior to Fall 2019; a major in <a href="/academic-programs/management/programs/business-organizations-management-major">Business, Organizations, and Management</a> for students enrolled in or after Fall 2019; and a <a href="/academic-programs/management/programs/business-minor">minor in Business</a>. 
</p><p>
	The Department of Management offers a major in Organization and Management Studies (OMS) and a minor in Business, which integrate the study of these important fields into the liberal arts and sciences.
</p><p>
	The OMS major explores organizations, how they behave within the context of societal issues, how people in those organizations behave, and how those organizations are managed. Students gain a strong foundation in organization theory and behavior, statistics, research methods, and systems thinking.
</p><p>
	The major is anchored in the social sciences, and reaffirms the central role of the liberal arts in studies of organizations and management. Critical thinking, rigorous inquiry, and the acquisition of knowledge-instead of just skills-are central to the OMS curriculum. The curriculum stresses intellectual boldness, creative problem solving, entrepreneurial thinking, and the practice of responsible management. It is an ideal major for anyone aspiring to a management or leadership position in business, government, the nonprofit sector, or any other organizational environment.
</p><p>Students who major in Organization and Management Studies (OMS) choose one of two tracks: Organizations and Society or Intra-Organizational Dynamics. Courses cover such topics as organizational culture, social responsibility, ethics, leadership, motivation, gender and diversity in organizations, and organizational change. The major gives an opportunity to dig deeply into some of the most important issues organizations grapple with today, including sustainability, corporate ethics, and globalization.</p><h3><b>Organizations and Society Track</b></h3><p>This track explores the dynamic relationships between organizations and society. Throughout history, organizations have played a pivotal role in shaping society. Rather than just studying organizations from a managerial perspective, courses in this track allow students to study organizations from a critical perspective. Equal consideration is given to various theories, such as stakeholder theory versus shareholder theory. Other topics include the purpose of corporations, organizations and global sustainability, organized labor and the distribution of wealth, organizing for green markets, ethics, corporate welfare, globalization, and organizations and social justice.</p><h3><b>Intra-Organizational Dynamics Track</b></h3><p>Intra-Organizational Dynamics examines the complex relationships among individuals, institutions, policies, structures, and organizational climate. A diverse range of courses gives students the opportunity to study topics related to organizational culture, workplace motivation, work and family balance, operations management, human resources, selection, organizational assessment, leadership, and organizational change.</p><p>Students majoring in OMS must complete six core courses, at least three courses from their chosen track (Organizations and Society or Intra-Organizational Dynamics), one course from the other track, and the capstone experience for their chosen track.</p><p><a href="/academic-programs/management/pdf/OMS_checksheet_Oct18.pdf">OMS Major Checksheet</a></p></div>

<div>

<p>At Gettysburg College, we see philosophy as a part of the well-lived life and as a bridge to all intellectual pursuits.  Philosophy is not about memorizing the views of past thinkers; it involves learning to think critically about life’s deepest questions, developing the skills of rational argument and graceful expression, and confronting the world’s challenges in ways that lead to insight, wisdom, and engagement. Philosophy points to the world, examines questions that elude empirical research, and considers the implications of what we know about the world and the human predicament. </p><p>Our classes include a wide range of topics and approaches, and we connect with other disciplines in courses like Philosophy of Art, Ethics &amp; Economic Life, Social &amp; Political Philosophy, the Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Film, and the Philosophy of Science. Our work is usually interdisciplinary; this leads to team teaching with faculty from other departments and offering First-Year Seminars with philosophical themes. </p></div>

	Courses 
</h4>
<div>

<li><span>PHIL-101 </span><span>Introduction to Philosophy</span><div>Study of selected philosophical issues that deal with such themes as knowledge, happiness, justice, death, and the nature of reality. The goals are to develop an ability to read philosophical texts with understanding and, through analysis and reflection, to form arguments regarding philosophical issues.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-102 </span><span>[Title Censored]: An Introduction to Philosophy</span><div>In considering the answers to many of the traditional questions in philosophy, a standard approach is to consider the exemplars of the practice.  For example, when Aristotle asks how we ought to live, he considers what it would be to be a virtuously magnanimous person.  But perhaps insight could come from the other direction as well.  In this class we will consider the ethically despicable character of the asshole as explicated by Aaron James and in terms of the search for truth, we will examine the nature of bullshit as analyzed by Harry Frankfurt.  Using these accounts of how not to be and think, we will turn to traditional questions in logic, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and social/political philosophy.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-103 </span><span>Critical Thinking</span><div>Informal logic course designed to help students reflect on and enhance their ability to think analytically and creatively. Discussions and exercises focus on techniques characteristic of informal logic (classification of arguments, analysis and evaluation of arguments, identifying informal fallacies, etc.), as well as strategies for intuitive and creative thinking.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-105 </span><span>Contemporary Moral Issues</span><div>Study of moral problems and larger philosophical questions they raise about such issues as the defensible use of violence, limits of freedom, extent of our obligations to others and to nature, rightful state authority, and the nature of duties and obligations. Selected readings focus on moral disputes as they arise in law and medicine, in international affairs, and in private moral reflection. Particular attention is given to ethical theories and to worldviews that shape positions on moral issues and guide moral decision-making.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-107 </span><span>Environmental Ethics</span><div>Exploration of ethical issues that arise regarding what responsibilities human beings have to the natural world. Specific issues such as population, land use, wilderness preservation, biodiversity, and our treatment of animals are examined in light of larger philosophical questions regarding nature and human purpose, obligations to future generations, the aesthetic and religious value of nature, and the possibility of an environmental ethic.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-109 </span><span>Wrong Science, Bad Science, Pseudoscience</span><div>Examination of three related issues: (1) the definition of science, what criteria distinguish real science from pseudoscience?, (2) the qualities of good science, what are the properties that make one theory or one research program better than another?, and (3) the relation between scientific research and the broader culture within which it is placed, what special moral responsibilities do scientists take on?</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-110 </span><span>Einstein and the Big Questions</span><div>Revolutionary thinkers give us new ways to view old problems.  So it is with Albert Einstein who wrote not only on science, but on philosophy, politics, economics, and religion.  This course looks at some of the classic problems in various parts of philosophy through traditional texts and then sees how Einstein challenged the standard positions.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-131 </span><span>Bioethics</span><div>Introduction to bioethics through the study of specific cases and problems. Students will be introduced to major principles in contemporary Western bioethical thought and practice, including concepts of personhood, consent, autonomy, justice, altruism, truth-telling and caring, as well as strategies that promote ethical decision-making. Students will also examine bioethical theories critically and comparatively, while  considering ethical dilemmas in various domains of medical research and practice.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-150 </span><span>Stand-up Philosophy: Humor, Art, and Ethics</span><div>An examination of philosophical questions raised by humor.  Humor is a ubiquitous human behavior, yet has long been denigrated as not a serious subject of intellectual inquiry.  This is mistaken.  In closely examining humor, we can raise traditional human questions and see philosophical methodology in action.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-180 </span><span>God, Death, and the Meaning of Life</span><div>An introduction to the methods, subfields, and questions of philosophy through the lenses of questions about religion and the meaningfulness of human life.  Questions of evidence for the existence of God, the existence and immortality of the human soul, and the meaning of life will be considered.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-205 </span><span>Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy</span><div>Study of philosophers and philosophies of ancient Greece and Rome. Emphasis is on the Pre-Socratics, Plato, Aristotle, Stoicism, and Skepticism.  PHIL 205 and CLA 205 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-206 </span><span>Medieval &amp; Renaissance European Philosophy</span><div>Study of leading thinkers in the western philosophical tradition, from the fifth to the fifteenth century. Special emphasis is on such figures as Augustine, Bonaventure, Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, and Pico della Mirandola.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-207 </span><span>Early Modern European Philosophy</span><div>Study of such major figures as Descartes,  Locke, Berkeley, Hume in seventeenth- and eighteenth- century European philosophy.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-208 </span><span>Kant &amp; 19th Century European Philosophy</span><div>Study of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and selected nineteenth-century European philosophers such as Hegel and Nietzsche.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-211 </span><span>Logic</span><div>Introduction to formal logic and a study of the formal uses of language, with particular reference to the nature of inference from premises to conclusion; rules for deductive inference; construction of formal proofs in sentential and predicate logic; and the nature of language.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-212 </span><span>Philosophical Methods</span><div>Study of the distinctive methods by which philosophical arguments are explored and defended across cultures, traditions, and historical contexts. The course will examine four broad methodological categories: interpretation, translation/comparison, critique, and argument/analysis.  Emphasis will be given to both the theoretical articulation and practical application of different methodologies. In addition to more traditional methods of argument and analysis, the course will include such approaches as phenomenology, hermeneutics, genealogy, dialectic, decoloniality, critical philosophy of race, feminist theory and gender theory.  Readings will be drawn from diverse philosophical traditions, historical periods, and philosophical movements and schools.  Prerequisite:  100-level PHIL course, or permission of the instructor.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-214 </span><span>Choice, Chance, Luck, and Fate</span><div>An examination of a central issue of metaphysics:  free will and the factors that may constrain or deny it.   The affirmation that human beings may choose their actions, which provides the basis for moral responsibility, is set against the deterministic view that all changes in behavior, all “choices” are caused.  The course considers various theories—libertarianism, compatibilisim, and “hard” and “soft” determinism; in addition, attention is given to interpretations of chance, randomness, luck, and fate as affecting human possibilities.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-215 </span><span>Latin American and Caribbean Philosophy</span><div>Historical survey of philosophy in the Americas, highlighting authors from various eras. Students will be exposed to ideas in all branches of philosophy, discussing metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics through the study of philosophical ideas from various sources, including indigenous, enslaved, and female authors. This course of study questions geographical and disciplinary boundaries, including the very idea of Latin America, itself.  PHIL 215 and LAS 215 are cross-listed.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-216 </span><span>Classical Chinese Philosophy</span><div>Critical panorama of the most significant contributions to Chinese philosophy from the beginnings of recorded civilization (first millennium B.C.E.) to the Han Dynasty (first century B.C.E.). Students read, analyze and discuss a variety of textual materials ranging from inscriptions in bronze vessels to philosophical treatises such as the Laozi and mantic poems from the Book of Change. Problem-oriented approach focusing in the underlying worldviews and philosophical arguments of the most influential classical Chinese thinkers.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-218 </span><span>Gender and Identity</span><div>An examination of the question of whether or not gender is an essential and defining feature of personal identity, largely socially constructed, or perhaps a  more fluid and dynamic interplay between nature and culture.  Readings will explore biological accounts of sexual identity, the distinction between sex and gender, the significance of gender in the history of philosophy, the influence of race and class on gender, and the contemporary theory of gender as performance.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-219 </span><span>Philosophy of Peace and Nonviolence</span><div>Study of philosophical arguments about pacifism and nonviolence.  Readings and films will explore the concepts and issues involved in considering peace as the absence of war between nations, peace as a social and economic goal, peace as an ethical principle, and peace as a personal ideal.  Particular attention will be paid to an analysis of different ways to conceptualize peace; as eradication of conflict, dialectical tension between diverse perspectives, or harmony and consensus.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-221 </span><span>Philosophy of Mind</span><div>An exploration of the nature of mind and leading theories of the relationship between mind and brain such as dualism, behaviorism, and mind/brain identity.  In light of contemporary developments in neuroscience and cognitive science, topics include consciousness and subjectivity, the language of thought and other accounts of mental content, the problem of other minds, physical versus psychological accounts of personal identity, and ethical issues in contemporary neuroscience.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-222 </span><span>Philosophical Perspectives on Justice</span><div>Study of the meanings and significance of justice for individuals and societies.  Course examines principles and questions regarding distributive and retributive justice raised in central texts of the western philosophical tradition and uses them to analyze students' own views and engage contemporary challenges for individual, local, and global justice.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-224 </span><span>Philosophy and Human Rights</span><div>Study of practical and theoretical issues of human rights and the philosophical questions they raise.  Are human rights applicable to all cultures?  Are women's rights human rights?   Can economic rights override political rights? Are some rights more important than others?  How should we understand charges of cultural relativism against the universal applicability of human rights?  The course will explore methods of terror such as killing, torture, disappearance, sexual assault and forceful recruitment by oppressive governments and war zone combatants.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-225 </span><span>Existentialism</span><div>Inquiry into what it means, in the view of existentialist philosophers, to "step forth" in the journey of becoming a self, a journey involving freedom, anxiety, despair, risk, choice and the possibility of inauthenticity.  The writings of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky are examined as the inspiration for twentieth-century existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir, Beckett) as well as the phenomenological and postmodern responses to existentialism.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-226 </span><span>Philosophy of Resistance</span><div>Study of the philosophy of social and political resistance as it arises from social unrest and the experience of structural violence.  Emphasis is placed on the relationship between injustice and social resistance, and on systems of structural violence such as slavery, caste systems and dictatorships.  Selected readings explore such issues as the nature of political and social resistance, the social conditions underlying resistance, the relationship between resistance and social change, and the paradox of violent resistance against injustice.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-227 </span><span>Beyond Terrorism</span><div>A study to provide a sound knowledge of the issues of terrorism and counter terrorism, and its impact on civil society.  By encouraging debate on practical and theoretical aspects of terrorism and counter terrorism, the course challenges students to develop a deeper understanding of many faces and consequences of terrorism. Students look at successful negotiations; ceasefire and peace settlements in ending terrorism. Overall this course addresses the question of how to preserve the values of civil society in the face of terrorism and counter terrorism.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-230 </span><span>Ethics</span><div>What is right and wrong? How to become a better person? Is it even possible to be or do good? With so many different and competing ideas in the world, how do we know which ideas to believe? Consider these and other fundamental questions in ethics across a range of theories and systems, including consequentialist, duty-, and virtue-based models, environmental ethics, and human rights, among others. Engage with a global range of philosophical texts and authors, through a diverse range of course material and assignments, including film, poetry, journalism, and speeches, as well as philosophical essays.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-232 </span><span>Environmental Philosophy</span><div>A study of the foundational issues, questions and philosophical frameworks that shape our relationship with the natural environment. The course will examine some of the most fundamental and influential movements and schools of thought within contemporary environmental philosophy and environmental ethics, including ecofeminism, ecophenomenology and deep ecology. Fatal flaws within the history of the Western philosophical tradition will also be assessed as we address the pressing issues and questions raised by the various ways in which we understand the environment and our relationship to it. Questions addressed in the course will include: How ought we to value nature and the environment? How should we understand the distinction between nature and culture? What ethical obligations do we have to non-human animals? How ought we to understand justice in relation to our environment and the environment we leave for future generations? Other issues including biodiversity loss, global climate change and environmental activism will also be explored throughout the course.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-233 </span><span>Philosophy of Science</span><div>Examination of the foundations of scientific reasoning.  Science draws conclusions about the working of the universe from observational evidence, but what kinds of arguments do they use to arrive at their results?  Applying the theoretical views of philosophers of science to case studies in the history of science, this course examines what is meant by "the scientific method."  Prerequisite: one course in philosophy or one course in any social or natural science.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-235 </span><span>Philosophical Ideas in Literature</span><div>A study of the relationship of philosophy to literature and the philosophical questions which arise from reflection on selected literary and philosophical works.  Readings explore themes of narrative masquerade, human identity, and the search for meaning, and debate questions of textual interpretation and the reader-text relationship.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-237 </span><span>Philosophy of Religion</span><div>Study of philosophical efforts to understand and justify religious beliefs. Course examines writings of philosophers who have answered such questions as: What is Religion? What is the importance or significance of specifically religious experiences? What account can we give of the meaning of religious claims? How can we mediate between apparently conflicting religious beliefs?</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-240 </span><span>World Philosophy</span><div>Study of selected writings from the world's philosophical traditions. Such themes as self and world, knowledge and its limits, the meaning and purpose of life, the nature of reality and ideals of moral perfection are explored in diverse philosophical traditions.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-243 </span><span>American Philosophy</span><div>Study of selected topics in colonial, early republic, nineteenth- and twentieth-century U.S. philosophy. Topics include deism, transcendentalism, pragmatism and historicism. Important secondary movements such as puritanism and evolutionism may also be considered.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-247 </span><span>Philosophy of Race</span><div>Study of race and racism from a philosophical perspective. Racial categories shape human lives, not simply by highlighting difference, but also by defining social, political, and cultural realities. In an effort to understand these realities, this course considers philosophical treatments of race alongside concrete social issues to address the following questions: What are the origins of the idea of race? What is the relationship between the use of racial categories and racial oppression? What role does race play in forming human identities?</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-252 </span><span>Social and Political Philosophy</span><div>An examination of the most influential philosophers in the history of social and political theory and an assessment of how their philosophical frameworks succeed or fail to provide guidance regarding contemporary political problems and issues.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-253 </span><span>Philosophy of Technology</span><div>Exploration of the social and cultural impact of technology and the philosophical  questions that technology raises.

Discussion will also focus on the social construction of facts and artifacts and the technological mediation of the relationship of self to world.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-260 </span><span>Truth, Belief, and Knowledge</span><div>An examination of the nature of knowledge.  Traditionally, knowledge has been defined as true, justified belief.  We will examine each of these three notions in detail and the various views about what they are.  We will then question the traditional definition and look at contemporary challenges to the existence of objective knowledge.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-265 </span><span>Jewish Humor: From Teyve to Seinfeld</span><div>Examination of the development and cultural context of American Jewish humor through the 20th century.  Jews played a significant role in the development of American comedy on stage, on radio, on the big screen, and on television.  This contribution comes from a cultural context in which Jews were both assimilating into the mainstream culture and aware of their alienation from it.  The use of humor is a double-edged sword, both bringing joy and laughter, but also allowing an oppressed minority group to make sharp points about injustices in the culture in which they live -- sometimes uncomfortably.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-303 </span><span>Analytic Philosophy</span><div>An examination of the development of analytic philosophy.  Starting with the crisis in mathematics at the end of the 19th century, leading to the development of formal logic and a re-evaluation of epistemology as a result of Einstein's theory of relativity, analytic philosophy developed new tools to solve and dissolve long-standing philosophical problems.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-314 </span><span>From Zero to Infinity: Philosophical Revolutions in Mathematics</span><div>Study of the philosophical foundations of mathematics starting with the concept of number and culminating the Godel's groundbreaking incompleteness result.  Specific topics include the historical developments and mathematical and philosophical ramifications of zero, rational, irrational, imaginary, and transfinite numbers as well as an examination of the completeness of arithmetic.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-315 </span><span>The Nature of Space: Philosophical Revolutions in Physics</span><div>Study of the notion of space as it has developed from Aristotle to Einstein. Particular focus will be given to relations between scientific accounts of the structure of space and the larger philosophical context in which they arose.  Course cross-listed as Philosophy 315.  Course does not count toward the physics major.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-316 </span><span>Philosophical Revolutions in Geometry</span><div>Study of the philosophical foundations and ramifications of the historical development of geometry.  Euclid's axiomatic system was held up by philosophers for centuries as the template for all thought.  But the development of non-Euclidean geometry gave rise to crucial questions about the foundations of mathematics and about the nature of knowledge more broadly.  Is geometry, or mathematics more broadly, a science?  Why are its results exact where other sciences are not?  If it is not a science, why is it indispensable for science?</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-318 </span><span>Ethics and Economic Life</span><div>A seminar on issues at the intersection of philosophy, psychology, and economics: the explanation and evaluation of human actions and choices.  Are we-as many thinkers have claimed-rational, self-interested, autonomous decision-makers?  How do such factors as altruism, risk and uncertainty, discounting the future, fairness, luck, and loyalties affect our choices?  How do pleasure, happiness, and well-being, and life itself serve as economic and ethical values? How can we be both moral agents and consumers, making rational, ethical choices in an uncertain world?</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-320 </span><span>Social Epistemology</span><div>Study of the social dimension of knowledge, collective intelligence and group decision-making and agency. Traditional epistemology has focused largely on individual knowers abstracted from social contexts. Social Epistemology focuses on knowledge as a collective enterprise and on the social creation and dissemination of knowledge. Issues of epistemic dependence and epistemic authority, testimony, peer disagreement, community standards of justification and critique, the nature and function of expertise and issues of social and moral responsibility are examined.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-328 </span><span>Deliberative Democracy</span><div>Study of different conceptions of democracy and what procedures insure fair and inclusive deliberation.  Students consider what constitutes the best form of government and whose vision should prevail?  Emphasis is placed on the debate between liberalism and communitarianism, the role of religion in democracies, the limits of free speech, the role of dissent, the basis of human rights, and the risks entailed in open spaces.  Particular focus is given to transitional and emerging democracies across the globe.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-329 </span><span>Shapes of Evil</span><div>Examination of the construction of notions of evil.  Using classical and contemporary texts from Western philosophy, religious thought, and literature, the course thematically engages five shapes of evil: 1) Evil and the Tragic (guilt and innocence in Greek thought); 2) Evil as Sin (the wicked will and God's role vis-a-vis evil);  3) Evil and Power; 4) The Mystique of Evil (the attraction of evil as embodied in the demonic "hero"); 5) Genocide and the Rhetoric of Evil.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-330 </span><span>Language, Truth &amp; Reality</span><div>Study of some major contemporary efforts related to traditional metaphysical issues. Topics include: Can philosophy tell us anything about the nature of our world? If so, how and what? To what extent is reality mind dependent? What is the relationship between language and reality?</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-331 </span><span>Emotion</span><div>A philosophical exploration of the nature and role of emotion in human life.  Course examines emotionality as a human capacity, emotional response as an experience, and specific emotion types, such as anger or fear.  Topics include the traditional opposition between reason and passion, between the cognitive and the emotive; the relation of emotion to morality; the possibility of "educating the emotions"; and philosophical issues related to particular emotions such as envy, jealousy, and embarrassment.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-332 </span><span>Philosophy and Mysticism</span><div>Philosophical examination of mystical texts in the western tradition.  In readings drawn from Jewish Christian, and Muslim traditions, students will explore the mystical understanding of God and human nature, the nature of love, the relationship between morality and mysticism, and the truth status of mystical experiences.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-334 </span><span>Philosophy of Art</span><div>A study of the contentious and, at times, subversive role that the artist and artwork have played in diverse philosophical traditions. Drawing on readings from within and beyond Western aesthetics, as well as traditional and contemporary poetry, painting, and music, the course examines the threat that the persuasive power of art poses to the philosopher, the homecoming that is promised by our experience of an artwork’s beauty, and the methods of resistance and critique that are opened up by artistic expression in a global and postcolonial world.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-335 </span><span>Philosophy of Film</span><div>The study of film as an artifact that both illuminates philosophical problems and poses new questions for philosophers about the nature of the self and community.  The course will examine how humans experience time and organize events and information through viewing film as a model of consciousness.  Students will also study film to identify how culture shapes both our identity and our perception of the "Other".</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-338 </span><span>Philosophy of Law</span><div>Study of enduring themes of legal philosophy, such as the nature of law, law and morality, liberty, responsibility, and justice, as well as such specific issues as civil disobedience, freedom of expression, privacy, compensation, and punishment. Emphasis is placed on differing philosophical perspectives that underlie disagreements about the law and on ethical questions that arise from the practice of law.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-339 </span><span>Philosophy of Music</span><div>A course that addresses philosophical questions about music, such as:  What is music?  What is a (particular) musical composition?  How is music related to our cognitions and emotions?  What is the tie between music and mathematics?  What is the relation of music to moral character?   Exploring such concepts as musical understanding, representation, expression, performance, and profundity, the course draws upon readings and music that span the centuries and the globe, and research from a range of disciplines.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-341 </span><span>Contemporary European Philosophy</span><div>Study of contemporary European and European-influenced philosophy. Course readings may include works by Heidegger, Derrida, Foucault, the French Nietzscheans (Bataille, Blanchot, Klossowski, Haar, Deleuze), French feminists (Kristeva, Irigaray, Cixous), and critical theorists (Adorno, Horkheimer). Course explores the interrelations between philosophy and disciplines- such as literature, psychoanalysis, political theory, and cultural criticism-and the ways in which contemporary continental philosophers both take up and alter the historical traditions of philosophy.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-342 </span><span>Philosophy of Chemistry</span><div>Examination of philosophical issues underlying chemistry.  Does all of chemistry reduce to physics or are there purely chemical laws of nature?  Does the use of models in chemistry mean that chemical explanations are true or merely useful heuristics?  Is there a single method underlying chemistry from physical to organic or is it a historical accident that these fields are grouped together?</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-343 </span><span>From Babylonia to the Big Bang:  The History and Philosophy of Cosmology</span><div>Examination of the development of views about the origin and evolution of the universe. From ancient times, humans have tried to answer the biggest of the big questions: where did it all come from? This course traces the course of the answers given from ancient mythology through contemporary models of contemporary Big Bang cosmology, focusing the interaction between advances in physical science and their philosophical ramifications.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-344 </span><span>Philosophy of Place</span><div>An exploration of the concept of place (versus space) and how place matters in our lives.  The course examines the meaning of particular places-home, gardens, cemeteries, battlefields (and athletic fields), prisons, sacred places, etc.-in the context of philosophical theories of place (historical and contemporary), moral geography, the representation of place, and the philosophy of architecture. These issues are studied in dialogue with the contrasting claim that the human good is independent of place.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-345 </span><span>Philosophy &amp; Christianity</span><div>Exploration of the relationship between philosophy and Christian belief.  Course examines the extent to which a "Christian philosophy" is possible; epistemic, metaphysical, and normative analyses of selected Christian doctrines; and critical examination of Christian and non-Christian perspectives on whether philosophy and faith are compatible.  Readings are drawn primarily from contemporary analytic and continental traditions.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-346 </span><span>The Philosophy of Color</span><div>A philosophical exploration of the phenomenon of color.  Our experience of color - an important aspect of our experience of the world - poses puzzling problems of metaphysics, epistemology, and aesthetics. To address these and related philosophical issues, this course draws upon multidisciplinary sources, examining: the science, natural history, and aesthetics of color; the symbolism of colors and color patterns in culture and in literature; the relation of color and emotion; and the claim of Western “chromophobia.”</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-351 </span><span>Philosophy of Humor</span><div>The purpose of this course is to examine the development of the philosophy of humor.  We will examine two primary areas – humor theory (what is humor?) and humor ethics (are there humor acts that are morally problematic?).  We will examine the history of philosophical discussions concerning humor, but focus on contemporary works in the field.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-355 </span><span>Nothingness</span><div>Asian philosophies started from examining absence, nothingness, and emptiness, rather than presence, being, and existence. Hinduist, Mahayana, Daoist, Zen, and Kyoto School philosophers employed ideas of nothingness to depict metaphysical principles, create ethical and self-cultivational ideals, and develop philosophies of knowledge, language, and action. Different versions of nothingness will become fundamental to explain continuity and change; argue for space-time causality; reflect on life, death, and rebirth; explore the self and its relation to the world; and understand how we think, how we use language, and how we can think, speak, and act differently. All philosophies of nothingness have a transformative power: they aim at transforming how we live by acquiring subtler insights on what is (not).  Prerequisite: One 100-level PHIL course, or a FYS taught by Philosophy faculty.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-366 </span><span>Great Philosophers</span><div>An immersion in the life and works of a single major philosopher. The course offers a three-dimensional perspective on the writings, biography, social context, and intellectual development of a significant philosopher, including interests that cut across disciplines. It also incorporates the best of contemporary scholarship on the subject’s thought and its continuing relevance.  The figure chosen will vary, but exemplars are: Plato, Rousseau, Tagore, Nietzsche, Mill, Heidegger, de Beauvoir, or James.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-368 </span><span>Reading (A Non-Philosopher)</span><div>An immersion in the life and works of an important thinker who, though not normally identified as a philosopher, produced a body of work with philosophical significance.  The course offers a close reading of major works, in the context of biography, social milieu, and intellectual developments.  The philosophical impact and continuing importance of the selected thinker will be examined also through contemporary scholarship.  Exemplars include:  Wollstonecraft, Darwin, Freud, Gandhi, or Einstein.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-400 </span><span>Senior Seminar</span><div>The capstone course in Philosophy, in which a range of philosophical and other texts are examined through the lens of a selected theme or topic.  Recent topics include: the Image, the Meaning of Life, the Seven Deadly Sins, Forgiveness, and Propaganda.  This course is required for the major and is normally limited to senior majors.</div><br/></li><li><span>PHIL-450 </span><span>Individualized Study-Tutorial</span><div>Individualized tutorial counting toward the minimum requirements for the major or minor, graded A-F.

	Program Description 
</h4>
<div>

<p>Political science is the study of governments, public policies and political processes, systems, and political behavior (APSA).</p><p>The department offers courses in <a href="/academic-programs/political-science/programs/department-subfields">four of the subfields of political science</a>: political theory (the history of political thought and normative theory); American government (institutions, political processes and political behavior); international relations(interstate behavior, international organizations international political economy, and transnational actors); and comparative politics (institutions, political processes of other states, political and economic development). The department uses both normative and empirical methodologies to examine political issues in all of the subfields, and a principal goal of the department is to teach students how to think analytically, write clearly and persuasively, and be inquisitive and imaginative as they contend with these issues.</p><p>The College’s location gives students an excellent historical vantage point from which to ponder contemporary political questions. As part of the liberal arts tradition, political science students acquire a variety of skills that prepare them for a wide range of <a href="/academic-programs/political-science/careers-alumni/careers.dot">careers</a> in the public and private sectors.</p><p>Political science students may experience a rich array of activities, including internships in a variety of settings; class visits from people in academia, the public and private sectors; and participation in approved study abroad programs or programs in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Finally, students are encouraged to build curricular bridges to related academic disciplines, such as environmental studies, economics, and history.</p></div>
<h4 id="political-science-program-requirements">
	Program Requirements 
</h4>
<div>

<p>All majors specialize in two of the four subfields in political science; therefore, they should give considerable thought to which subfields they pursue as they complete the major. <a href="/academic-programs/political-science/pdfs/2019/PoliSciMajorChecklist.pdf">View the Political Science Major Check Sheet</a> (PDF).</p><h2>Major requirements:</h2><p>A minimum of 10 courses in political science. The <a href="/academic-programs/political-science/programs/department-subfields">courses are categorized in four general subfields</a> of the discipline: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Political Theory. Students take three introductory courses, two 200 and two 300 level courses, an elective at the 200 or 300 level, the methods course, and the capstone.</p><p><strong>Introductory Courses:</strong> Majors are required to take three of the four introductory courses. The options are: Political Science 101 American Government; 102, Introduction to Political Theory; 103 Introduction to International Relations; or 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics. Courses at this level introduce students to the core set of themes that define Political Science including the manner in which they are conceptualized by the particular subfield.  The 100-level courses may be taken in any order, and should be completed by the end of the sophomore year. Occasionally, certain First Year Seminars offered by members of the department may be used to satisfy one of the introductory courses. Students should consult their First Year Seminar instructors to see if their seminar is applicable. Introductory courses are prerequisites for all advanced courses. Students who submit an AP score of 4 or 5 in American Government may receive course credit for POL 101. Course credit for advanced placement will be lost if a student takes POL 101 at Gettysburg.</p><p><strong>Political Science Methods:</strong> All students must take Political Science 215, Political Science Research Methods, as sophomores or first-semester juniors. Starting with the Fall Term 2012, students must earn a grade of C (2.0) or better in POL 215 to graduate with a major in political science.</p><p><strong>Subfield Specialization: 200 level courses: </strong>Courses at this level explore key themes and related issues in greater depth. Students learn about the research process and how to pursue their own research questions. All students must choose two subfields from the three represented in their introductory courses. All students must take at least one 200 level course in each of these subfields.</p><p><strong>Subfield Specialization: 300 level courses:</strong> At this level students engage in a critical and deeper examination of specific topics that exemplify the core set of themes of importance to political scientists. All students must follow up the 200 level courses with at least one 300 level course in each of their selected subfields.</p><p><strong>Elective:</strong> Students may fulfill the elective requirement by taking either a 200 or 300 level course in one of the three subfields taken at the introductory level.</p><p><strong>Capstone:</strong> The capstone course serves as the culmination of the communication conventions in the discipline. Students will be immersed in a specific area of scholarship, will read, analyze and finally produce research relevant to the topic of the course. All seniors must enroll in a senior capstone course. The course must be in one of the two subfields pursued in the major. Capstone seminars in American Politics, International Relations, and Comparative Politics will be offered every year. The capstone in Political Theory will be offered every other year. Students who are unable to take the Political Theory capstone in their senior year may enroll in it in their junior year.</p><p><strong>Honors:</strong> Majors will receive Honors in Political Science if they maintain a 3.67 grade point average in the major and complete the senior capstone with a 4.00 (A) grade.</p><p><strong>Off Campus Courses:</strong> Students are encouraged to pursue off campus programs. Political Science course credit will be given to those courses that are consistent with the department’s subfield designations. Political science courses taken off campus will satisfy 200-level requirements only, and only two political science courses taken off campus can satisfy major requirements.</p><p><strong>Internships: </strong>Students are encouraged to take internships for academic course credit, but they are graded S/U and do not fulfill any major requirements. Students need to work with the Center for Career Development and consult with a faculty member on the nature of the internship and its academic requirements.</p><p><strong>Individualized Study: </strong>Individualized study provides an excellent opportunity for students to work with a faculty member on an important political topic and produce a significant research paper. Students need to consult with a faculty member on choosing the topic and arranging the requirements of the course. Individualized Study is graded A-F, is calculated in the major grade point average, but does not fulfill any major requirements.</p><h2>The Minor in Political Science</h2><p>Students intending to minor in political science need to understand the subfield orientation of the minor as well as the minor requirements. Prof. Roy Dawes is the department advisor for the minor and students should consult with him on choosing courses to fulfill the minor requirements. At this time, students should formally declare the minor.  Prof. Dawes will sign their minor declaration form which they will then turn in to the Registrar’s office.</p><p>The minor in political science consists of six courses in political science. All minors specialize in two of the four subfields in political science; therefore, they should give considerable thought to which subfields they pursue as they complete the minor.</p><p><strong>Minor requirements:</strong></p><p><strong>Introductory Courses:</strong> Minors are required to take two of the four introductory courses. The options are: Political Science 101 American Government; 102, Introduction to Political Theory; 103 Introduction to International Relations; or 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics.</p><p><strong>Advanced Courses:</strong> Minors are required to take four courses at the 200 or 300 level that are consistent with the subfields chosen at the introductory level. These courses cannot all fall in the same subfield. The usual sequence of courses is two courses in each subfield but some students take three in one and one in the other. Students may substitute POL 215 Political Research Methods for one of these courses.</p></div>

<div><p>Gettysburg College is committed to helping students who are interested in pursuing careers in the legal field. While there is no designated major or program curriculum (nor is it necessary for entry into law school), faculty and staff are available to help students navigate the challenges of preparing for and applying to law school.</p>
<p>Gettysburg provides many resources for students, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/offices/center-for-career-engagement/students/graduate-professional-school/pre-law-advising/">Personalized advisement when thinking about and planning for Law School </a></li>

</ul>
<p> 
In addition to the resources listed above, Gettysburg College has a Moot Court, which is coached by Professor Scott Boddery. Professor Boddery also offers Legal Analysis (POL 399), which is mirrored after the first year law course taken by all law students nationwide.  Legal Analysis is a unique course that is rarely offered at the undergraduate level, and it sets apart Gettysburg College’s pre-law curriculum from those programs at peer institutions and large research universities.</p>
<p>
 
Likewise, the Center for Career Engagement works closely to help students gain exposure and hands-on experience through job shadows, externships, campus programs with alumni/parents in the legal field, and more! Combining academics with opportunities such as these, students are able to explore the field of law in a broader sense and build skills that will serve them well in law school or in other professions they wish to pursue.

<p>
Students who are interested in pre-law advising can contact Professor Boddery (sboddery@gettysburg.edu) in Political Science, or Tiffany Kurzawa (tkurzawa@gettysburg.edu) in the Center for Career Engagement to arrange an appointment.</p>

<h2>Course Suggestions</h2>
<p><a name="courses"></a>As there is no designated pre-law major at Gettysburg, students are encouraged to take courses and select a major that they are passionate about, are challenged in, and enjoy – all of which should lead to academic success. While there are a few majors that may seem ‘typical’ in choosing a law school path, many law schools aren’t focused on your particular major, so find something the fits your interests!</p>
<p>Courses (or extracurricular activities) that involve <b>research, critical thinking, writing, and public speaking</b> are great to consider. You’ll be expected to do a lot of each of these in law school and it is important to practice these skills.</p>
<p>We’ve put together a few course options to consider, which can equip you with some knowledge and skills for taking the LSAT and/or attending law school.</p>

<div>

<p>Gettysburg College’s historic location, well-established partnerships with a wide range of museums and historical organizations, and commitment to experiential education provide a solid foundation for the minor in Public History.</p><p><b>What Is Public History?</b></p><p>As a discipline, public history revolves around the politics and practice of preservation and interpretation, in public settings and in conversation with public audiences. A wide variety of subfields cluster under the umbrella of public history, ranging from curation, museum education, and historic preservation to interpretation, documentary film, and archival management.</p><p>The coursework for the minor will enhance students’ skills in historical research, cultural analysis, presentation, public engagement, collaboration with community partners, and digital technology. The interdisciplinary curriculum will provide students rich perspectives on the complex relationship between cultural practices, historical narratives, and material objects, and include substantial emphasis on field education and hands-on work. As future professionals, minors will be well-positioned to continue their education on a graduate level, while as citizens, they will be better equipped to advocate for more democratic, intellectually rigorous representations of history in the public sphere.</p><p>Students with a focus on Public History can pursue graduate study in history, public history, museum studies, art history, anthropology, library science, film studies, public policy, education, ethnic studies, public humanities, geography, sociology, or American Studies. They can also seek employment in fields ranging from museums, libraries and historic preservation to education, consulting, and government.</p><p><b>Contact Information</b></p><p>For more information about the Public History minor, please contact Prof. Jill Ogline Titus (<a href="mailto:jtitus@gettysburg.edu">jtitus@gettysburg.edu</a>) or Prof. Peter Carmichael (<a href="mailto:pcarmich@gettysburg.edu">pcarmich@gettysburg.edu</a>).</p><h3>Minor Requirements:</h3><ul>

<div>

<p>If you’re driven to serve or make meaningful changes in public arenas, a Public Policy major can give you the foundation you need. You’ll focus on quantitative and economic analysis and the study of domestic and international institutions that make policy—governments, nonprofits, and international organizations.</p><p>Topics include:</p><ul>
<li>Problem recognition and articulation</li>
<li>Policy development</li>
<li>Ethical and legal deliberation</li>
<li>Analytic methods and policy impact assessment</li>
<li>Economic concepts</li>
<li>History</li>
</ul><p>In advanced courses, you’ll focus on policy areas of particular interest to you, working with a faculty coordinator to define your unique course of study. Your capstone seminar will include a formal analysis of a substantial public policy problem, and you’ll gain field experience through a required internship.</p><p>Public Policy graduates regularly pursue graduate studies in business administration, economics, environmental studies, health policy and administration, law, political science, psychology, public administration, public policy analysis, social work, sociology, and urban affairs.</p><h3>Dual major</h3><p>Use the public policy major as a complement to another field of study. A public policy dual major can give you a rich understanding of policy with the eye of a specialist.</p><p>If you’re interested in:</p><p>Science policy, you might dual major in Public Policy and Physics</p><p>Health policy, you might dual major in Public Policy and Health Sciences or Biology</p><p>Family policy, you might dual major in Public Policy and Sociology.</p></div>

<p>The public policy major at Gettysburg College offers a flexible, rigorous, multidisciplinary curriculum that provides training for students interested in problem-solving in domestic or international public arenas. Core courses focus on the nature of public policy, including the process of problem recognition and articulation, policy development, ethical and legal deliberation and methods of policy impact assessment.</p><p>The public policy major is intended to accommodate students from a wide range of interests that include a public policy dimension and serves as a second major for students whose study of public policy builds on the substantive knowledge of the first major. Students interested in science policy might choose the public policy major after their declaration of physics as a first major. Students interested in health policy might choose the public policy major after a declaration of health sciences or biology as their major. Students interested in family policy might choose the public policy major in conjunction with a sociology major.</p><p>The major in public policy emphasizes quantitative and economic analysis, the study of political institutions that make policy, and the examination of specific policy areas chosen by the student. Courses include analytic methods, economic concepts, ethical analysis of political institutions, grounding in history, and field experience gained from a required internship. Students choose advanced courses focusing on particular policy areas according to their interests, with the guidance of a faculty coordinator. A formal analysis of a substantial public policy problem is undertaken in a capstone policy seminar.</p><p>The major encourages students to achieve many of the goals that shape the Gettysburg College vision of a liberal arts education. Students are expected to draw upon skills from multiple disciplines, to learn to write well, to read critically, to assess significant ethical issues that affect policy debate, and to think analytically about global and domestic problems.  </p><p>Public Policy graduates regularly pursue graduate studies in business administration, economics, environmental studies, health policy and administration, law, political science, psychology, public administration, public policy analysis, social work, sociology and urban affairs. </p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>All Public Policy majors are required to have another major in addition to Public Policy.</p><p>All public policy majors are required to take the following core courses:</p><ul>
<li>Pol Sci 101 (American Government) or Poli Sci 103 (Intro to International Relations) or Poli Sci 104 (Intro to Comparative Politics)</li>
<li>PP 221 (Introduction to Public Policy)</li>
<li>Econ 103 (Principles of Microeconomics) and Econ 104 (Principles of Macroeconomics)</li>
<li>Statistics/Methods (<a href="#stats">choose from these statistics/methods courses</a>)</li>
<li>PP 470 Internship (requires approval from public policy adviser and Chair of public policy)</li>
<li>PP 401 (Capstone seminar, Advanced Topics in Public Policy)</li>
</ul><p>Students must take an additional four elective courses in an area of their interest. These courses must be approved by their public policy adviser and the Chair of public policy. The four elective courses must include one course in each of the following categories:</p><ul>
<li>Values and public policy: courses that treat the ethical dimensions of public policy</li>
<li>Theory and public policy: courses that provide a theoretical or conceptual framework for understanding public policy issues</li>
<li>Policy and policy making: courses that focus on the institutions through which public policy is made</li>
<li>Elective: any course in the student’s area of policy interest</li>
</ul><p>Students generally enter the Public Policy major with interests in a particular subject area. Below we provide a sample set of courses satisfying the requirements for the Public Policy major, organized by subject areas that students have identified as areas of interest in the past. These sample curricula are intended to inspire students to construct a set of courses appropriate to their own interests, not to limit their options. Students are encouraged to identify their area of interest and select appropriate courses in consultation with their advisor. A large number of courses offered at Gettysburg College and off-campus study programs can be used to satisfy the requirements for the major.</p><p>Courses taken in off-campus study programs may be used to satisfy any of the above requirements with the approval of the Chair of public policy.</p><p>No more than two courses used to fulfill the requirements of a student’s other major may count toward the public policy major. (Exception: Economics and Mathematical Economics majors may use Econ 103, 104, and 241 to satisfy the requirements for both Economics/Mathematical Economics and Public Policy.)</p><h2>Courses that fulfill the Statistics/Methods Requirement</h2><p>Normally students take the statistics/methods course required by their other major.</p><ul>

<p>The study of religion provides all the benefits of any other liberal arts humanities major, and the department offers a diverse curriculum.  Faculty specialize in different geographic regions, time periods, and methodologies, and we bring the breadth of our global experience into the classroom.  We can acquaint you with the cultures of the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Europe, and the Americas.  </p><p>In this increasingly globalized world, we work with people from many different cultures in our careers, and it is imperative that we be able to communicate with one another.  Religious studies courses implicitly train students to re-evaluate their own most deeply held values and beliefs.  They encourage critical thinking--that is, objective, informed, and balanced insight and analysis--which can facilitate open-mindedness and communication.</p><h3>Major Requirements</h3><p>Ten courses are required for the major. At least two courses must be at the 200-level; at least two courses must be at the 300-level or above. Beginning with the class of 2020, majors must take REL 260: <em>Theories of Religion</em> (ideally prior to taking the senior capstone), which trains students in the theories and methods of the academic study of religion. This counts as one of the 200-level courses. In addition to the two required 300-level or above courses, beginning with the class of 2019 majors must take REL 400: <em>Capstone Experience in Religious Studies</em> in their senior year.</p><p>Majors and minors are encouraged to take Religion 101 early in their careers, though it is not a requirement for the major. Students are encouraged to take courses that examine varying religious traditions and religion in varying regions and contexts.</p><h3>Minor Requirements</h3><p>Six courses are required for the minor. At least one must be at the 200 level, and at least one must be at the 300 level or above. One of the six may be taken outside the department, but may not be in the student's major. Minors are encouraged to take REL 260: <em>Theories of Religion.</em></p><p>Up to two courses from outside the department may be counted toward a major or minor upon permission of the department chair and on a case-by-case basis.</p></div>
