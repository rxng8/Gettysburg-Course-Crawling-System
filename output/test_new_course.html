<h2>Major</h2>
<p>The Africana Studies major requires that you take 10 courses. Students can take the courses in any sequence, although we recommend starting with the lower-level courses. All majors must take 2 of the introductory courses and the Africana intellectual history course. In line with the diasporic outlook of the program, students must take at least one course on each of the geo-cultural regions: Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Black America (US). Students are also required to take a gender-specific course. In addition to these requirements, majors must complete 3 elective courses. Finally, all majors must have a capstone/senior seminar experience. Please note that at least 2 of the courses for the major must be at the 300-level and no more than 3 of the 10 courses may be individualized study courses, including the capstone.

<li><strong>A Capstone Experience - </strong>Fulfilled by Biology 307, 314, 320, 334, 335, 351, 460, or 461. All of these courses require independent research as well as a research or review paper.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements for the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Biology</h3>
<p>Students seeking the B.S. in Biology must fulfill all of the requirements listed for the B.A., plus the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>One additional elective biology course</strong> (for a total of 10 biology courses)</li>
<li><strong>One additional course in a related department</strong> (from the above list for a total of five courses in related departments - only one of the CS courses can count for the Biology major)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For those considering graduate or medical school</h3>
<p>Students applying to most medical school programs, and some other medically-related graduate schools, such as dental school, are required to complete two years of Chemistry (105 or 107, 108, 203, &amp; 204), one year of Physics (103-104 or 109-110 or 111-112), and one or two courses in Mathematics (usually 105-106, or 111 and/or 112). Most PhD programs are more flexible (see: <a href="/academic-programs/biology/current-students/graduate-school/">Graduate school for a masters or doctoral program</a>), but some do also prefer students to take both Organic Chemistry (Chem 203 &amp; 204) and Physics, in addition to the usual Biology major requirements. Students who do complete all of these courses only need 5 Biology electives (instead of 6) for the B.S., or 4 Biology electives (instead of 5) for the B. A. Students considering any graduate program should work closely with their advisor to plan their course of study.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Minor in Biology</h3>
<p>Students qualify for a minor in Biology by completing six courses in Biology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biology 111 (or 110 or 113) and 112. Both courses with at least a C- grade.</li>
<li>Four additional Biology courses that count toward the major.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students selecting upper-level courses to meet the requirements for the minor must also fulfill any prerequisites that may be required for those courses</p> <p> </p>

<li>Two additional elective courses, selected from the areas listed above or in Research Methodology (Biology 260*, 460, and 461)</li>
</ul>
*Bio 206, 229, and 307 may count for the Organismal group <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span></b> the Population/Community group.<br/> **Bio 315 may count for the Cellular/Molecular <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span></b> the Population/Community group.<br/> Bio 111 (or 110) and 112 are prerequisites for all upper level Biology courses.<br/>Bio 113 can substitute for Bio 111 (or Bio 110)<br/>Bio 110 is intended as a prerequisite to Bio 112 for non-Biology majors.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li><strong>Four courses in related departments, to include:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry 107 (or 105) and 108 (or 118) - to be typically taken in the first year</li>
<li>A mathematics course, selected from: Biology 260*; Mathematics 105-106, 107, 111, 112, Psychology 205</li>
<li>One elective, selected from: Chemistry 203, 204; Chem/Phy 246; Computer Science 111 (or 107); Environmental Studies 223; Physics 103, 104 or 109; 110, 111, or 112; Psychology 236, 237, or 238; HS326.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Note: If Biology 260 is chosen to meet the mathematics course requirement, it may not also count as a biology elective course.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>A Capstone Experience - </strong>Fulfilled by Biology 307, 314, 320, 334, 335, 351, 460, or 461. All of these courses require independent research as well as a research or review paper.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements for the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Biology</h3>
<p>Students seeking the B.S. in Biology must fulfill all of the requirements listed for the B.A., plus the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>One additional elective biology course</strong> (for a total of 10 biology courses)</li>
<li><strong>One additional course in a related department</strong> (from the above list for a total of five courses in related departments - only one of the CS courses can count for the Biology major)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For those considering graduate or medical school</h3>
<p>Students applying to most medical school programs, and some other medically-related graduate schools, such as dental school, are required to complete two years of Chemistry (105 or 107, 108, 203, &amp; 204), one year of Physics (103-104 or 109-110 or 111-112), and one or two courses in Mathematics (usually 105-106, or 111 and/or 112). Most PhD programs are more flexible (see: <a href="/academic-programs/biology/current-students/graduate-school/">Graduate school for a masters or doctoral program</a>), but some do also prefer students to take both Organic Chemistry (Chem 203 &amp; 204) and Physics, in addition to the usual Biology major requirements. Students who do complete all of these courses only need 5 Biology electives (instead of 6) for the B.S., or 4 Biology electives (instead of 5) for the B. A. Students considering any graduate program should work closely with their advisor to plan their course of study.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Minor in Biology</h3>
<p>Students qualify for a minor in Biology by completing six courses in Biology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biology 111 (or 110 or 113) and 112. Both courses with at least a C- grade.</li>
<li>Four additional Biology courses that count toward the major.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students selecting upper-level courses to meet the requirements for the minor must also fulfill any prerequisites that may be required for those courses</p> <p> </p>

<h2>The Minor in Educational Studies</h2>
<p>The Minor in Educational Studies is designed to help students explore education as a social and cultural phenomenon by applying historical, psychological, and philosophical lenses to their investigation of its many iterations and forms. Students completing a minor in Educational Studies are well prepared to pursue teaching in graduate school or through alternative licensure programs after leaving Gettysburg, and are also well prepared to explore other opportunities in the field of education after graduation.</p>
<p>The minor is also designed to engage students in social policy issues related to education and to help students become more informed citizens by developing their understanding of the complexity of education as both a formal process and as a cultural phenomenon. The exact program of study for each minor is designed in consultation with a faculty advisor and includes six courses typically organized around a thematic core.</p>
<h3><strong>Guidelines &amp; Requirements for the Minor in Educational Studies</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>An introductory course in education: Education 199 or Education 201</li>
<li>Two courses at the advanced (300) level or higher</li>
<li>Three additional electives</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that one approved course taken off campus may be counted toward the minor, and no more than two courses may be taken at the introductory (100) level. At least four courses must be taken in the Education Department or carry an EDUC prefix.</p>
<h3><strong>The Education Project<br/></strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the required six courses that all students completing the minor must take, minors are also strongly encouraged to complete a self-designed applied project or research project in education. The Education Department is committed to working closely with the Center for Public Service to help students become immersed in the local community in an effort to make a difference in the lives of local residents, and several courses offered by the faculty of the department include field-based components that allow students to explore any of a number of different ideas and issues in a variety of educational settings. In the past students have been actively involved in local schools, have helped tutor English language learners at El Centro, have volunteered at the local YWCA, and have been involved in other programs on and off campus that have helped them make an impact on the education of kids in the Gettysburg community. These kinds of projects are strongly encouraged, as are more formal research projects, some of which may even be taken for course credit (students should discuss such options with an Education Advisor).<br/><br/>Students who wish to receive course credit for their projects may consider applying for internship or independent study credit. Students are also encouraged to present their research at Celebration or in other such venues. Students completing an Education Project will also be recognized at the department’s Capstone Presentation event.</p>
<h3><strong>Program Approval</strong></h3>
<p>Courses that are included in the minor program of study must have a substantial focus on education as a formal process or on issues related to education. Each student's program must be approved by the Education Department. To get started, students should visit the Education office in 106 Weidensall, or contact any faculty member in the department. Ultimately each prospective minor will need to obtain a signed green form declaring the minor with the Registrar and will also need to provide his or her Education Advisor with a list of the six courses to be included in your minor. This can be accomplished that by printing the form below and having an advisor in the Education Department sign it.</p>

<h2><a name="engmajem"></a>Major in English with Education Minor</h2>
<p>The English major can be combined with a minor in secondary education, along with a teaching certification.  All English majors who are interested in receiving certification in secondary education should meet with their major advisor and the chair of the Education department no later than the fall of their sophomore year to begin planning how they will meet departmental, college, and state requirements.</p>
<p>Students pursuing education certification take a range of courses in literature, in writing, and in the history or structure of the English language. They develop both historical depth and awareness of the diverse voices that have helped shape literary tradition.  The secondary education program also requires an “education semester” of student teaching in the senior year, or as an additional semester after graduation.</p>
<p><em>More information on requirements for adding an <a href="/academic-programs/education">Education Minor</a> to the major in English.</em></p>
<p>English majors seeking teaching certification follow the standard English major except, instead of their two electives, they must take:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 200-level intermediate writing course. ENG 205 fulfills the Multiple Inquiries Arts requirement.</li>
<li>One elective, which may be ENG 111, 112, 113, CLA 103, or designated FYS in literature; a second 200-level writing course or a 300-level literature or writing course; or an academic-year internship or individualized study. </li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary education students should take a variety of English, American, and African American literature. They are also encouraged to take a Shakespeare course. THA 214, 329, or 331 may serve as a substitute for one ENG literature course.</p>

<p>An English minor requires <strong>six courses</strong> in English.  Although it is not necessary to declare an English minor before the senior year, students are encouraged to talk to an English professor if interested in pursuing a minor.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two 200-level intermediate literature courses. <em>ENG 210 - 289.</em></li>

<p>English with a Writing Concentration is designed for those students who want a concentration of writing courses while still earning an English degree.</p>
<p>This major requires <strong>fourteen courses</strong> — more than the standard English major, but less than the combination of an English major with a writing minor. Students experience a balance of literature and writing courses.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ENG 205, <em>pre-requisite for all 300-level writing courses. </em></li>
<li>Three 200-level literature courses. <em>Eng 210 - 289</em></li>
<li>One 200-level Theories and Methods course.<em> Eng 290 - 299, pre-requisite for 400-level seminar.</em></li>
<li>Four 300-level literature courses. <em>Eng 310 - 399. </em></li>
<li>Three advanced writing courses. <em>Eng 300 - 309.</em></li>
<li>One 400-level seminar. <em>Eng 400-405</em></li>
<li>One elective.<br/>-<em>May be a 100-</em>level literature course.* <br/>-Additional 200-or 300-level literature or writing courses may count<br/> -English 101 may not be used to fulfill the department's major.<br/>-May be an academic-year internship or individualized study.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*ENG 111, 112, 113, CLA 103, or designated FYS in literature.</em></p>
<p>Three of the fourteen courses must focus on literature before 1800.</p>
<p>Beginning with the class of 2023: three of the fourteen courses must focus on literature before 1900. Two of these three must focus on literature before 1800. One course must focus on literature after 1900. Also, one 200-, 300-, or 400-level course that focuses on literatures of diversity must meet the Conceptualizing Diversity and/or Global Understanding requirement of the college.</p>
<p>Up to two literature courses taken outside the English Department may count toward the Writing Concentration major. (Advisor must provide approval to Registrar's Office for such courses to count in English.)</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad:</strong> Two courses (one 200-level and one 300-level) from a semester-abroad program may count toward the major. A third course (200- or 300-level) from a full-year abroad program may count.</p>

<h2><a name="engmajem"></a>Major in English with Education Minor</h2>
<p>The English major can be combined with a minor in secondary education, along with a teaching certification.  All English majors who are interested in receiving certification in secondary education should meet with their major advisor and the chair of the Education department no later than the fall of their sophomore year to begin planning how they will meet departmental, college, and state requirements.</p>
<p>Students pursuing education certification take a range of courses in literature, in writing, and in the history or structure of the English language. They develop both historical depth and awareness of the diverse voices that have helped shape literary tradition.  The secondary education program also requires an “education semester” of student teaching in the senior year, or as an additional semester after graduation.</p>
<p><em>More information on requirements for adding an <a href="/academic-programs/education">Education Minor</a> to the major in English.</em></p>
<p>English majors seeking teaching certification follow the standard English major except, instead of their two electives, they must take:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 200-level intermediate writing course. ENG 205 fulfills the Multiple Inquiries Arts requirement.</li>
<li>One elective, which may be ENG 111, 112, 113, CLA 103, or designated FYS in literature; a second 200-level writing course or a 300-level literature or writing course; or an academic-year internship or individualized study. </li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary education students should take a variety of English, American, and African American literature. They are also encouraged to take a Shakespeare course. THA 214, 329, or 331 may serve as a substitute for one ENG literature course.</p>
<p><a href="/academic-programs/english/pdf/2019/RequirementsforEnglishMajorwSecondaryEduMinor.pdf">English Major with Teacher Certification Program Checksheet</a> (PDF)</p>
<h2><a name="engmin"></a>Minor in English</h2>
<p>An English minor requires <strong>six courses</strong> in English.  Although it is not necessary to declare an English minor before the senior year, students are encouraged to talk to an English professor if interested in pursuing a minor.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two 200-level intermediate literature courses. <em>ENG 210 - 289.</em></li>
<li>Two 300-level advanced literature courses<em>. ENG 310 - 399.</em></li>
<li>Two electives:<br/><em>– No more than one introductory literature course (English 111, 112, 113, CLA 103, or designated FYS in literature)</em>. <br/>– <em>Writing courses at 200- or 300-level may be counted for one or both electives.</em><br/>
– <em>One may be an academic-open internship or individualized study.</em></li></ul></div>

<h3>The Environmental Studies Major</h3>
<p>The Environmental Studies major is interdisciplinary with courses that draw from the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Students choose either a Bachelor’s of Arts degree (BA) or a Bachelor’s of Science degree (BS), and pursue an in-depth area of concentration. It is strongly recommended that upon declaring of the ES Major, students develop an ES major plan in consultation with an ES advisor. The plan should include a brief outline of future courses, internships, off-campus study, and independent research. While the plan may change, it encourages students to think intentionally about their academic careers and better prepare them to take full advantage of the learning opportunities available both on and off campus. Graduate schools often require particular coursework for admission, so students considering graduate school should speak with their ES advisors as early as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Core Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>Environmental studies majors, both BA and BS, take six core courses. Students typically take ES196 in their first year, and complete the 200-level core courses (211, 223, 225, and 230) by the end of the sophomore year. The 400-level capstone requirement is met in the senior year.</p>
<ul>
<li>ES 196 Environmental Science and Society</li>
<li>ES 211 Principles of Ecology</li>
<li>ES 223 Earth System Science</li>
<li>ES 225 Introduction to Environmental Humanities</li>
<li>ES 230 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems</li>
<li>ES 400 Environmental Studies Seminar <i>OR</i> ES 460 Honors Thesis</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Bachelor of Arts Requirements</h2>
<p>The Bachelor of Arts degree comprises a minimum of 11 courses. In addition to the six core courses listed above, students must take five elective courses at the 200 or 300 level outside the core. Up to two elective courses may be taken off-campus or in other departments, subject to advisor approval. All majors should complete an area of concentration through their choice of electives.</p>
<h2 id="esbs">Bachelor of Science Requirements</h2><p>The Bachelor of Science degree comprises a minimum of 14 courses. In addition to the six core courses listed above, students will take:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Additional Opportunities</h3>
<p><strong>Cinema and Media Studies</strong></p>
<p>Students interested in the BA might also consider doing Cinema and Media Studies as a major or minor. Cinema and Media studies include studying cinema and other popular media through the lenses of Cultural Studies. Students will understand media as not merely artistic forms, but also as cultural, economic, and socio-political entities. See the <a href="/academic-programs/cinema-media-studies/programs/">Cinema and Media Studies website</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Data Science</strong></p>
<p>Students interested in the BS have the option of doing Data Science as a minor. The data science minor integrates quantitative methodologies from mathematics, statistics, and computer science with effective communication, interdisciplinary teamwork, social and ethical context, and domain knowledge from a student’s major field of study. See <a href="/academic-programs/interdisciplinary-studies/programs/data-science/">the Interdisciplinary Studies website</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Public Policy</strong><br/> Students interested in Environmental Policy have the option of doing Public Policy as a second major. The public policy major at Gettysburg College offers a flexible, rigorous, multidisciplinary curriculum that provides training for students interested in problem-solving in domestic or international public arenas. <a href="/academic-programs/public-policy/programs/major">More about the Public Policy Major</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Degree Programs </strong></p>
<p>Students spend 3 years at Gettysburg College and 2 years at a graduate institution.</p>

<h3>Additional Opportunities</h3>
<p><strong>Cinema and Media Studies</strong></p>
<p>Students interested in the BA might also consider doing Cinema and Media Studies as a major or minor. Cinema and Media studies include studying cinema and other popular media through the lenses of Cultural Studies. Students will understand media as not merely artistic forms, but also as cultural, economic, and socio-political entities. See the <a href="/academic-programs/cinema-media-studies/programs/">Cinema and Media Studies website</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Data Science</strong></p>
<p>Students interested in the BS have the option of doing Data Science as a minor. The data science minor integrates quantitative methodologies from mathematics, statistics, and computer science with effective communication, interdisciplinary teamwork, social and ethical context, and domain knowledge from a student’s major field of study. See <a href="/academic-programs/interdisciplinary-studies/programs/data-science/">the Interdisciplinary Studies website</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Public Policy</strong><br/> Students interested in Environmental Policy have the option of doing Public Policy as a second major. The public policy major at Gettysburg College offers a flexible, rigorous, multidisciplinary curriculum that provides training for students interested in problem-solving in domestic or international public arenas. <a href="/academic-programs/public-policy/programs/major">More about the Public Policy Major</a>.</p>

<p>The globalization studies major is both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. Students <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/apply/">must apply</a> to the major and design their own course of study following the guidelines outlined below. Course requirements for the twelve-course major consist of five core courses, three courses in each of two tracks, and a senior capstone project. Globalization Studies majors must also <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/study-abroad/">study abroad</a> or complete some other off-campus program. The requirements are outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>Core Requirements (five courses)</strong></p>
<p>Core requirements for the major include four foundation courses and one methods course. Students are encouraged to complete the core requirements by the end of the sophomore year. The purpose of these core courses is to provide a common base of knowledge for all students as well as a basic set of skills and tools with which they can analyze global issues from the perspective of cultures, states, non-state actors, and systems. All five core courses must be taken on campus. Foundation courses, for which majors must earn a grade of C- or better, include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anth 103 Introduction to Cultural Anthropology</li>
<li>Econ 104 Principles of Macroeconomics</li>
<li>GS 225</li>
<li>Pol 103 Introduction to International Relations <i>or</i> Pol 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics</li>
</ul>
<p>No AP credits will be accepted for foundation courses.</p>
<p>Students take one course from among the discipline-based methods courses currently offered on campus. Students should take the methods course that best fits with the thematic track they choose for the globalization studies major. This course must be taken before the capstone, and majors must earn a minimum grade of C-. The methods courses students may choose from include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ANTH 323 Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology</li>
<li>ARTH 214 Methods in Art History</li>
<li>CIMS 226 Media and Cultural Theory</li>
<li>ECON 241 Introductory Economics and Business Statistics</li>
<li>ES 230 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems <i>or</i></li>
<li>ES 196 Environmental Science and Society</li>
<li>GER 240 Intro to German Studies: Methods and Theories</li>
<li>HIST 300 Historical Method</li>
<li>HS-232 Statistics for the Health Sciences</li>
<li>HS-326 Epidemiology</li>
<li>OMS 235 Statistical Methods</li>
<li>Pol 215 Political Science Research Methods</li>
<li>SOC 302 Research Methods</li>
<li>SPAN 304 Hispanic Linguistics Today</li>
<li>SPAN 305 Intro to Literary/Cultural Studies</li>
<li>WGS 340 Methods</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Tracks (six courses) </strong></p>
<p>Students take courses in each of two self-designed tracks. Up to three courses may be taken off campus, and students who study abroad two semesters may apply four off-campus courses to the major, though no single track may contain more than two off-campus courses.</p>
<p> <strong>Regional track </strong></p>
<p>The major requires three courses that focus on a single region of the student’s choosing. The purpose of these courses is to ground students in the realities of a particular geographic region's experiences with the processes of globalization. Students can choose to take courses that examine independently and comparatively the history, politics, economics, cultures, literatures, and fine arts of sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Western Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East and North Africa. Students may also define other regions for study, provided that the proposed curriculum and rationale are approved.</p>
<p>One of the three courses should focus on some historical aspect of the region in question and one course on some aspect of society and culture in the region. The courses that make up the regional track must draw from at least two disciplines. As part of the process of declaring the globalization studies major, students are asked to provide a rationale for their choice of regional track. The courses for the regional track must be taken at the 200 level and above, with at least one course at the 300 level or higher. Finally, students should complete the College's foreign language requirement in a language appropriate to the region on which they have chosen to focus plus one additional year of language. See language requirements below.</p>
<p> <strong>Thematic track </strong></p>
<p>The major requires three courses with a thematic focus. The purpose of these courses is for students to gain in-depth knowledge of some substantive area of globalization studies that combines different disciplines. The courses that make up the thematic track must draw from at least two disciplines. As part of the process of declaring the globalization studies major, students are asked to provide a rationale for their choice of thematic track and must demonstrate a link between their thematic track and methods course. The courses for the thematic track must be taken at the 200 level and above, with at least one course at the 300 level or higher.</p>
<p> <strong>Capstone/Senior Seminar  </strong></p>
<p>Students take an interdisciplinary capstone seminar, GS 440, during the spring of their senior year. The seminar, offered by faculty teaching in the globalization studies program, requires students to conduct research on some challenge currently facing the global system. Majors must earn a minimum grade of C-. Students must complete the methods course and off-campus study before enrolling in the capstone.</p>
<p>GS 440: An intensive seminar experience in which students in the final semester of their GS major will have an opportunity to interact, learn, and bond as a cohort. The capstone will meet once a week for 2.5 hours, during which time students will undertake a common core of coursework related to Globalization as an interdisciplinary field of study. A major objective of the capstone is the completion of an individual capstone project or thesis which reflects a synthesis of the student's regional studies, thematic tracks, study abroad experience, and capstone-related independent research. Students are expected to present their work in a public forum.</p>
<p> <strong>Study Abroad or other off-campus study </strong></p>
<p>Globalization Studies majors are required to spend at least one semester <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/study-abroad/">studying abroad</a> or participating in some other off-campus program, such as the Washington, D.C., semester programs offered through American University and Lutheran College.  Students should select a program that complements the Regional Track of their major.</p>
<p> <strong>Language Requirements for GS Majors </strong></p>
<p>All GS majors graduating in 2014 or later must also take four foreign language courses. The first two courses are required to meet the college's language requirement. The next two courses can be in the same language or in one or two additional language(s). These can be taken on campus or off campus. Half-credit language courses, such as those offered by SIT in less-commonly taught languages, will count. Languages should be appropriate to the regional track.</p>
<p> <strong>For Those Planning to Double Major </strong></p>
<p>Students who declare a major in addition to the globalization studies major may count up to three courses from their other major toward the requirements for the globalization studies major.</p> <p> </p>

<p>The globalization studies major is both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. Students <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/apply/">must apply</a> to the major and design their own course of study following the guidelines outlined below. Course requirements for the twelve-course major consist of five core courses, three courses in each of two tracks, and a senior capstone project. Globalization Studies majors must also <a href="/academic-programs/globalization-studies/study-abroad/">study abroad</a> or complete some other off-campus program. The requirements are outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>Core Requirements (five courses)</strong></p>
<p>Core requirements for the major include four foundation courses and one methods course. Students are encouraged to complete the core requirements by the end of the sophomore year. The purpose of these core courses is to provide a common base of knowledge for all students as well as a basic set of skills and tools with which they can analyze global issues from the perspective of cultures, states, non-state actors, and systems. All five core courses must be taken on campus. Foundation courses, for which majors must earn a grade of C- or better, include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anth 103 Introduction to Cultural Anthropology</li>
<li>Econ 104 Principles of Macroeconomics</li>
<li>GS 225</li>
<li>Pol 103 Introduction to International Relations <i>or</i> Pol 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics</li>
</ul>
<p>No AP credits will be accepted for foundation courses.</p>
<p>Students take one course from among the discipline-based methods courses currently offered on campus. Students should take the methods course that best fits with the thematic track they choose for the globalization studies major. This course must be taken before the capstone, and majors must earn a minimum grade of C-. The methods courses students may choose from include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ANTH 323 Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology</li>
<li>ARTH 214 Methods in Art History</li>
<li>CIMS 226 Media and Cultural Theory</li>
<li>ECON 241 Introductory Economics and Business Statistics</li>
<li>ES 230 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems <i>or</i></li>
<li>ES 196 Environmental Science and Society</li>
<li>GER 240 Intro to German Studies: Methods and Theories</li>
<li>HIST 300 Historical Method</li>
<li>HS-232 Statistics for the Health Sciences</li>
<li>HS-326 Epidemiology</li>
<li>OMS 235 Statistical Methods</li>
<li>Pol 215 Political Science Research Methods</li>
<li>SOC 302 Research Methods</li>
<li>SPAN 304 Hispanic Linguistics Today</li>
<li>SPAN 305 Intro to Literary/Cultural Studies</li>
<li>WGS 340 Methods</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Tracks (six courses) </strong></p>
<p>Students take courses in each of two self-designed tracks. Up to three courses may be taken off campus, and students who study abroad two semesters may apply four off-campus courses to the major, though no single track may contain more than two off-campus courses.</p>
<p> <strong>Regional track </strong></p>
<p>The major requires three courses that focus on a single region of the student’s choosing. The purpose of these courses is to ground students in the realities of a particular geographic region's experiences with the processes of globalization. Students can choose to take courses that examine independently and comparatively the history, politics, economics, cultures, literatures, and fine arts of sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Western Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East and North Africa. Students may also define other regions for study, provided that the proposed curriculum and rationale are approved.</p>
<p>One of the three courses should focus on some historical aspect of the region in question and one course on some aspect of society and culture in the region. The courses that make up the regional track must draw from at least two disciplines. As part of the process of declaring the globalization studies major, students are asked to provide a rationale for their choice of regional track. The courses for the regional track must be taken at the 200 level and above, with at least one course at the 300 level or higher. Finally, students should complete the College's foreign language requirement in a language appropriate to the region on which they have chosen to focus plus one additional year of language. See language requirements below.</p>

<p>There is a distinctive vibrancy to a Sunderman Conservatory education.</p>
<p>The Conservatory offers three music degrees and an extraordinary range of opportunity for all students. As part of Gettysburg College, the Conservatory resides within an energetic liberal arts community that blends academic pursuits and engaged commitment to a broad spectrum of activities, service and creative endeavors.</p>
<p>But most of all, the Conservatory prides itself on the synergy between its students and the notable faculty who span the breadth of musical excellence. Indeed, it's this invaluable sharing of ideas, creativity and knowledge that enables Conservatory students to develop their voices as musicians as they rise to their full potential as adults.</p>
<p>The Sunderman Conservatory is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM).</p>

<p><strong><a name="bamusic"></a>Bachelor of Arts in Music</strong></p>
<p>The Bachelor of Arts in music degree is designed for students with serious preparation for and interest in the study of music within a liberal arts context. Students build strong musical foundations through performance, applied study, music theory, music history, and world music. Advanced work in the major continues with a selection of courses that serve to concentrate and contextualize students' understanding of music.</p>
<p>Some students may choose to work with a faculty mentor to focus on particular areas of interest within music (for example, composition, conducting, teaching, jazz studies, musicology, ethnomusicology) through coursework, independent study, or internships.</p>
<p>The BA in Music offers a broad array of options, including the opportunity to pursue a second major or a minor in another disciplinary field. Graduates have gone on to pursue careers in music performance, composition, conducting, teaching, musicology, and ethnomusicology and in related fields such as arts management, arts marketing, music recording, and music librarianship. Others have completed graduate or professional programs in law, medicine, chemistry, physics, math, and numerous other fields while continuing to remain involved in music as an avocation. Admission to the Bachelor of Arts in Music is by audition.</p>

<p><strong><a name="bsmusic"></a>Bachelor of Music Education<br/></strong></p>
<p>This 36-course degree prepares students for careers as music educators at all levels in public and independent schools upon graduation. The curriculum treats all aspects of music education, including general music, vocal/choral music, and instrumental music. Music education students are given a wealth of classroom experience prior to graduation and will develop the performance skills essential to good teaching through applied lessons, large and small ensemble participation, and an impressive variety of performance opportunities. Non-Western traditions and approaches to popular music are integrated throughout the music education curriculum. While the majority of graduates move immediately into a teaching career, some may also choose to pursue graduate work in music education or in music performance, composition, or arts administration. Approximately one-half of the coursework is in music, while another 15 percent is in education courses. Students earn Pennsylvania K-12 music teaching certification upon successful completion of all requirements. Admission to the Bachelor of Music Education is by audition.</p>

	For students enrolled at Gettysburg College prior to Fall 2019 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The Department of Management offers a major in <strong>Organization and Management Studies (OMS)</strong> for students enrolled at Gettysburg College prior to Fall 2019; a major in <a href="/academic-programs/management/programs/business-organizations-management-major">Business, Organizations, and Management</a> for students enrolled in or after Fall 2019; and a <a href="/academic-programs/management/programs/business-minor">minor in Business</a>. 
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
	The Department of Management offers a major in Organization and Management Studies (OMS) and a minor in Business, which integrate the study of these important fields into the liberal arts and sciences.
</p>
<p>
	The OMS major explores organizations, how they behave within the context of societal issues, how people in those organizations behave, and how those organizations are managed. Students gain a strong foundation in organization theory and behavior, statistics, research methods, and systems thinking.
</p>
<p>
	The major is anchored in the social sciences, and reaffirms the central role of the liberal arts in studies of organizations and management. Critical thinking, rigorous inquiry, and the acquisition of knowledge-instead of just skills-are central to the OMS curriculum. The curriculum stresses intellectual boldness, creative problem solving, entrepreneurial thinking, and the practice of responsible management. It is an ideal major for anyone aspiring to a management or leadership position in business, government, the nonprofit sector, or any other organizational environment.
</p>
<p>Students who major in Organization and Management Studies (OMS) choose one of two tracks: Organizations and Society or Intra-Organizational Dynamics. Courses cover such topics as organizational culture, social responsibility, ethics, leadership, motivation, gender and diversity in organizations, and organizational change. The major gives an opportunity to dig deeply into some of the most important issues organizations grapple with today, including sustainability, corporate ethics, and globalization.</p>
<h3><b>Organizations and Society Track</b></h3><p>This track explores the dynamic relationships between organizations and society. Throughout history, organizations have played a pivotal role in shaping society. Rather than just studying organizations from a managerial perspective, courses in this track allow students to study organizations from a critical perspective. Equal consideration is given to various theories, such as stakeholder theory versus shareholder theory. Other topics include the purpose of corporations, organizations and global sustainability, organized labor and the distribution of wealth, organizing for green markets, ethics, corporate welfare, globalization, and organizations and social justice.</p>
<h3><b>Intra-Organizational Dynamics Track</b></h3><p>Intra-Organizational Dynamics examines the complex relationships among individuals, institutions, policies, structures, and organizational climate. A diverse range of courses gives students the opportunity to study topics related to organizational culture, workplace motivation, work and family balance, operations management, human resources, selection, organizational assessment, leadership, and organizational change.</p>
<p>Students majoring in OMS must complete six core courses, at least three courses from their chosen track (Organizations and Society or Intra-Organizational Dynamics), one course from the other track, and the capstone experience for their chosen track.</p>

<p>All majors specialize in two of the four subfields in political science; therefore, they should give considerable thought to which subfields they pursue as they complete the major. <a href="/academic-programs/political-science/pdfs/2019/PoliSciMajorChecklist.pdf">View the Political Science Major Check Sheet</a> (PDF).</p>
<h2>Major requirements:</h2>
<p>A minimum of 10 courses in political science. The <a href="/academic-programs/political-science/pdfs/2019/PoliticalScienceCoursesbySubfield2015-2018.pdf">courses are categorized in four general subfields</a> (PDF) of the discipline: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Political Theory. Students take three introductory courses, two 200 and two 300 level courses, an elective at the 200 or 300 level, the methods course, and the capstone.</p>
<p><strong>Introductory Courses:</strong> Majors are required to take three of the four introductory courses. The options are: Political Science 101 American Government; 102, Introduction to Political Theory; 103 Introduction to International Relations; or 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics. Courses at this level introduce students to the core set of themes that define Political Science including the manner in which they are conceptualized by the particular subfield.  The 100-level courses may be taken in any order, and should be completed by the end of the sophomore year. Occasionally, certain First Year Seminars offered by members of the department may be used to satisfy one of the introductory courses. Students should consult their First Year Seminar instructors to see if their seminar is applicable. Introductory courses are prerequisites for all advanced courses. Students who submit an AP score of 4 or 5 in American Government may receive course credit for POL 101. Course credit for advanced placement will be lost if a student takes POL 101 at Gettysburg.</p>
<p><strong>Political Science Methods:</strong> All students must take Political Science 215, Political Science Research Methods, as sophomores or first-semester juniors. Starting with the Fall Term 2012, students must earn a grade of C (2.0) or better in POL 215 to graduate with a major in political science.</p>
<p><strong>Subfield Specialization: 200 level courses: </strong>Courses at this level explore key themes and related issues in greater depth. Students learn about the research process and how to pursue their own research questions. All students must choose two subfields from the three represented in their introductory courses. All students must take at least one 200 level course in each of these subfields.</p>
<p><strong>Subfield Specialization: 300 level courses:</strong> At this level students engage in a critical and deeper examination of specific topics that exemplify the core set of themes of importance to political scientists. All students must follow up the 200 level courses with at least one 300 level course in each of their selected subfields.</p>
<p><strong>Elective:</strong> Students may fulfill the elective requirement by taking either a 200 or 300 level course in one of the three subfields taken at the introductory level.</p>
<p><strong>Capstone:</strong> The capstone course serves as the culmination of the communication conventions in the discipline. Students will be immersed in a specific area of scholarship, will read, analyze and finally produce research relevant to the topic of the course. All seniors must enroll in a senior capstone course. The course must be in one of the two subfields pursued in the major. Capstone seminars in American Politics, International Relations, and Comparative Politics will be offered every year. The capstone in Political Theory will be offered every other year. Students who are unable to take the Political Theory capstone in their senior year may enroll in it in their junior year.</p>
<p><strong>Honors:</strong> Majors will receive Honors in Political Science if they maintain a 3.67 grade point average in the major and complete the senior capstone with a 4.00 (A) grade.</p>
<p><strong>Off Campus Courses:</strong> Students are encouraged to pursue off campus programs. Political Science course credit will be given to those courses that are consistent with the department’s subfield designations. Political science courses taken off campus will satisfy 200-level requirements only, and only two political science courses taken off campus can satisfy major requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Internships: </strong>Students are encouraged to take internships for academic course credit, but they are graded S/U and do not fulfill any major requirements. Students need to work with the Center for Career Development and consult with a faculty member on the nature of the internship and its academic requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Individualized Study: </strong>Individualized study provides an excellent opportunity for students to work with a faculty member on an important political topic and produce a significant research paper. Students need to consult with a faculty member on choosing the topic and arranging the requirements of the course. Individualized Study is graded A-F, is calculated in the major grade point average, but does not fulfill any major requirements.</p>
<h2>The Minor in Political Science</h2>
<p>Students intending to minor in political science need to understand the subfield orientation of the minor as well as the minor requirements. Prof. Roy Dawes is the department advisor for the minor and students should consult with him on choosing courses to fulfill the minor requirements. At this time, students should formally declare the minor.  Prof. Dawes will sign their minor declaration form which they will then turn in to the Registrar’s office.</p>
<p>The minor in political science consists of six courses in political science. All minors specialize in two of the four subfields in political science; therefore, they should give considerable thought to which subfields they pursue as they complete the minor.</p>
<p><strong>Minor requirements:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introductory Courses:</strong> Minors are required to take two of the four introductory courses. The options are: Political Science 101 American Government; 102, Introduction to Political Theory; 103 Introduction to International Relations; or 104 Introduction to Comparative Politics.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Courses:</strong> Minors are required to take four courses at the 200 or 300 level that are consistent with the subfields chosen at the introductory level.
