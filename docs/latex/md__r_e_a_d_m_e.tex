This script grabs all of the relevant content for the course catalog from the gettysburg.\+edu website and compiles into a single HTML file. It extracts all of the urls from a csv of the with the given format (NEED TO ADD).

When grabbing the content from each page, this script assigns the section a new id created from its url path for the sake of linking to it throughout the document. Additionally, all non-\/external links re-\/created to link to the aforementioned id.

Pages are added to the final HTML file in the order they are listed in the csv.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{About Gettysburg Course Catalog Project}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
Snapshot script to crawl the relevant pages of the Gettysburg College website to fetch the Course Catalog content and generate a single HTML file with structured headings.

Main sections\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Title and date generated
\item Table of contents
\item 1 -\/ Academic Policies
\item 2 -\/ Admissions Policies
\item 3 -\/ Financial Policies
\item 4 -\/ Degree Requirements
\item 5 -\/ Programs of Study (54 programs, including majors and minors)
\item 6 -\/ Faculty Registry
\end{DoxyItemize}

The output is designed to be used as source for a Word or In\+Design document to generate an accessible PDF.

Reference documents\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{./src/model/model-document.pdf}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily model-\/document.\+pdf}}}\+: Year 2019 PDF as an example of what the finished document should look like
\item \href{./src/model/model-output.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily model-\/output.\+html}}}\+: HTML markup template that the crawl script should render

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The codebase of the package is located in \href{../src/catalog_engine}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily src/catalog\+\_\+engine/}}}.
\item The codebase consists of the following files\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{../src/catalog_engine/scraper.py}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily scraper.\+py}}}\+: Scraper class which only crawl all sites from page.\+csv, and put them into data structures, i.\+e, list of soup, and mapper from each line to the soup. This class have been finished and does not need more change (for now)
\item \href{../src/catalog_engine/extractor.py}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily extractor.\+py}}}\+: Extractor classes which only focus on taking those data structures we have from the Crawler, and organize and extract to build a kind of key, value dictionary, list according to the template model that Adrian gave us. (We can easily generate json file from this data structure, too!).
\item \href{../src/catalog_engine/generator.py}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily generator.\+py}}}\+: Generator class which only focus on generating the output html file. So far I just have the generators that output every subjects (subjects, major-\/minor, courses, program) but not the curriculum and policies.
\item \href{../src/catalog_engine/explorer.py}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily explorer.\+py}}}\+: Code for courses api communication.
